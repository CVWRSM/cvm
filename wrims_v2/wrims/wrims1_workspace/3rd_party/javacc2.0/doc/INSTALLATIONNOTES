Since JavaCC is completely Java, both JavaCC and the code it generates
will run on all compliant platforms.  We have encountered bugs in
various implementations of Java over the past many months for which we
have incorporated workarounds so that you will not notice any
problems.

JavaCC is packaged for release with the Metamata installer - a fancy
pure Java installer that can automatically install JavaCC on a variety
of platforms automatically and make it ready for use right away.

The installer is invoked by running the downloaded class file as a
Java program as follows:

	java JavaCC1_2

In case you prefer to perform a command line installation, type:

	java JavaCC1_2 -c

Please let us know if you have any problems with installing JavaCC so
that we may share it with other users.
