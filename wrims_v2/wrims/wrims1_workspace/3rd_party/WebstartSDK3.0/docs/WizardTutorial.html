      <blockquote>
	  This tutorial is provided to get you started writing wizards using
	  the Web Start wizard API.  This tutorial walks through the steps
	  required to create a simple wizard, and demonstrates the implementation
	  of wizard panels, a ServerObject, and a wizard builder..

      <h3><a name="Example Wizard Description">2.  Example Wizard Description</a></h3>
      <blockquote>
	  This tutorial will help you create a wizard that displays the
	  amount of free space available on disk filesystems that the user
	  selects.  This example wizard is designed to demonstrate how to
	  write wizard panels and demonstrate the communication between the
	  wizard client and server.  Also included in this tutorial is
	  an example ServerObject implementation and the builder that creates
	  the wizard archive.
	  <p>

      <h3><a name="Wizard Creation Steps">3.  Wizard Creation Steps</a></h3>
      <blockquote>
	There are two steps required to create a working wizard:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Write the wizard builder.</li>
	    <li>Run the wizard builder to create the wizard archive.</li>
	  </ol>

	  Creating the wizard builder is the focus of this tutorial, and can
	  be broken into several steps:
	      <ol>
		<li>Create a <a href="#Example Wizard Storyboard">wizard storyboard</a></li>
		<li>Design the <a href="#Example Wizard Client Tree">wizard client tree structure</a>.</li>
		<li>Design the <a href="#Example Wizard Server Side">server-side objects (Task, ServerObject)</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="#Creating Custom Panels">Implement required panels</a></li>
		<li><a href="#Initialization of the WizardState Object">Initialize the WizardState object</a>.</li>
		<li>Add required resources to the wizard.</li>

      <h3><a name="Example Wizard Storyboard">4.  Example Wizard Storyboard</a></h3>
      <blockquote>
	  Before any code is written, it is useful to have a really good idea
	  what the wizard is supposed to do, identify the contents and behavior
	  of the panels included in the wizard, design the client tree, and
	  create an interface for communication between the client objects and
	  the server objects.
	  <p>
	    The storyboard created in this section of the tutorial will reveal the
	    purpose of the wizard, the information the wizard must collect from
	    the user, the information the wizard will display to the user, and
	    how that information is divided into wizard panels.
	  <p>
	    Our wizard's purpose is to display filesystem free space to the user.
	    To this end, our wizard will have custom panels to request information
	    from the user and then display the filesystem information.
	  <p>
	    A filesystem is a section of a disk.  A filesystem is often viewed by
	    the user as a real disk.  On Microsoft Windows, for example, the
	    filesystems are labeled with drive letters (A:&#92;, B:&#92;, C:&#92;, etc).
	    The user will often refer to the "C:&#92;" filesystem as the "C drive".
	  <p>
	    The information the wizard will request from the user is the list
	    of filesystems that should be queried for free space.  It may seem
	    that we should just get it over with and request the free space on
		all filesystems.  Be aware that on many operating systems (including
	    Microsoft Windows) a filesystem name will be listed for removable
	    drives even if no disk is inserted.  This has the quite annoying effect
	    of asking the user via an error dialog box to insert a disk in the
	    specified drive.  That is why this example wizard will query the
	    user for the list of filesystems to report.
	  <p>
	    The information this wizard will display is a list of filesystem names
	    (which the user selected) and the corresponding amount of available
	    space on that filesystem.
	  <p>
	    This example wizard will consist of three panels:  
	    Welcome, 
	    <a href="#FilesystemSelection Panel">FilesystemSelection</a>,
	    and <a href="#FilesystemSummary Panel">FilesystemSummary</a>.
	  <p>
		The Welcome panel will be used to indicate to the user the purpose
		of this wizard.  This is done to align the expectations of the
		user.  This panel might have a label that reports:
	      <blockquote>
		  <p>
		    "This wizard reports the amount of space available on your disk filesystems."
	      </blockquote>
	      <p>
		If the user's intent was to create a new disk filesystem, this message would
		indicate that this wizard does not do that.
		<p>
		The Welcome panel will be an instance of
		<a href="api/com.sun.wizards.panels.TextImagePanel.html">TextImagePanel</a>,
		configured to display the desired text.
	      <p>
	    The FilesystemSelection panel will display a list of filesystem names and
	    Checkbox components that allows the user select which filesystems should
	    be queried.  The user would check the box next to the filesystems that
	    are to be queried for available space.
	  <p>
	    The FilesystemSummary panel will indicate to the user the amount of free
	    space left on each filesystem selected in the FilesystemSelection panel.
	    The display of this information will be done using standard Label objects.
	  <p>
		
      </blockquote>
      <h3><a name="Example Wizard Client Tree">5.  Example Wizard Client Tree</a></h3>
      <blockquote>
	  The wizard client tree is a structure that defines the order of the wizard
	  panels and the rules for displaying those panels.
	  <p>
	    The example wizard consists of only three panels, and has a very simple
	    client panel tree.
	  <p>
	    All three of the panels in the example wizard will be displayed.  The
	    client panel tree that describes this behavior is a root node
	    (WizardComposite) that is the parent of all three panels.  This is illustrated
	    in the following diagram:
	      <p>

	      <p>
	  <h3><a name="Example Wizard Server Side">6.  Example Wizard Server Side</a></h3>
	  <blockquote>
	      The server side of the example wizard will be responsible for getting the list
	      of filesystem names and the amount of available space on each filesystem
	      the user specifies.  These activities could not be done within the wizard
	      client because the client may be running in a web browser.  Certainly
	      querying for filesystem information would not be allowed by the browser's
	      security manager.
	      <p>
		There are two possibilities for creating this server-side support:
		a Task or a ServerObject.  
	      <p>
		A Task is an element within a Sequence which can be performed or
		reversed.  A Sequence can be executed in blocking mode or 
		non-blocking mode.  The non-blocking mode is useful if the Sequence
		is expected to take a long time.  If the Sequence is executed in
		blocking mode, the caller (usually a panel) will have its thread
		blocked until the Sequence is complete.  This effect can be quite annoying
		because the result is that the user interface is frozen until the
		Sequence is complete.  The Tasks within the Sequence do not report directly
		back to the caller.  Instead, a callback method is registered, so at
		the end of the Sequence execution an object can be notified of its completion.
	      <p>
		In this example wizard, the behavior we would like to achieve is that
		the client makes a call to the server and the return value is the information
		we want.  This is the way ServerObjects work.  For this to work, the method
		that is called should return without delay.  Since the two operations we
		need (getting filesystem names and getting filesystem free space) do not
		take a significant amount of time, the ServerObject strategy seems to
		fit nicely.
	      <p>
		ServerObject is an interface with two required methods:  
		<a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.ServerObject.html#addRuntimeResources(java.util.Vector)">addRuntimeResources()</a>
		and <a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.ServerObject.html#setWizardState(com.sun.wizards.core.WizardState)">setWizardState()</a>.
	      <p>
		The addRuntimeResources method is part of the resource collection
		mechanism.  This method should add all required Java classes that are
		not part of the Java core classes to the specified Vector object.  This
		method is only executed at build time, and is used by the builder to
		figure out which classes need to be included in the wizard archive.
	      <p>
		The setWizardState method is used to initialize the ServerObject
		with a reference to the correct WizardState.  This method is executed
		only at wizard initialization time (when the wizard is executed).  The
		WizardState reference is required to communicate with other server
		or client objects.
	      <p>
		The example ServerObject must have a method to retrieve the filesystem
		names from the system.  This method will be called getFilesystemNames,
		and will return a String array.  Each element within the returned array
		will be a String object representing one filesystem.  The length of the
		array will reveal the number of valid filesystems.
	      <p>
		Another method required by this example wizard will return the amount of
		free space for specified filesystems.  This method will be called
		getFilesystemFreeSpace.  getFilesystemFreeSpace will accept a String array
		representing the filesystem names to query for free space and will return
		a Long array, each element of which will reveal the amount of free space
		available on the respective filesystem.
	      <p>
		getFilesystemNames() and getParitionFreeSpace() will use the SystemInterface
		reference maintained by the ArchiveReader.  The SystemInterface is used
		to supplement the Java support by providing platform-specific functionality.
<p>
<h4><a name="FilesystemServerObject">FilesystemServerObject</a></h4>
	      <p>
		Following is the source to the FilesystemServerObject.  This code should
		be written into a file called FilesystemServerObject.java within the "classes"
		directory of this SDK.

	  <h3><a name="Creating Custom Panels">7.  Creating Custom Panels</a></h3>
	  <blockquote>
	      Often, wizard implementation will include writing a custom wizard
	      panel.  The panel will appear in the wizard frame above the Navigation
	      Panel and to the right of the Image Panel.
	      <p>
		A wizard panel is an object subclassed from
		<a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardLeaf.html">WizardLeaf</a>.
		The methods that a WizardLeaf subclass often override are
		createUI, beginDisplay, isDisplayComplete, abortDisplay,
		and addRuntimeResources.
		<p>
		createUI is the method in which the user interface of the wizard
		panel should generally be created.  The reason the gui should be
		created here is that this method is only called once (just before
		the panel is displayed) in the lifecycle of the wizard panel.
		<p>
		The beginDisplay method is called each time the panel is displayed.
		This method is often used to synchronize the information being
		displayed in the panel with the information contained in the
		wizard server.
		<p>
		The isDisplayComplete method is called when the user presses the
		"Next" button.  This method returns a boolean.  False means that the
		user did not complete this panel correctly.  Either the information
		entered was incorrect or the panel has not been completed.  True
		means that the panel has been completed, and the next panel may be
		displayed.
		<p>
		The abortDisplay method is called when the user presses the
		"Back" button.  This gives the panel a chance to clean up before
		the previous panel is displayed.
		<p>
		The addRuntimeResources method is used to collect the names of the
		classes required when the panel in question is added to the wizard.
		Each class added to the specified Vector will be included in the
		wizard archive.
		<p>
		Panels communicate with other panels through the wizard server.  A
		wizard panel can set data into the server that another panel can
		read.  In this way, data can be passed between panels quite easily.
		<p>
		In this example, two custom panels must be written.  The FilesystemSelection
		panel will collect from the user a list of filesystems to query for free
		space.  This list will be set into the wizard server under the key
		"selectedFilesystems".  The FilesystemSummary panel will read the data
		from the server and display information about the filesystems in the list.

	It seems that we have all of the pieces of our wizard written.  This
	section of the tutorial ties it all together into a working wizard.
	<p>
	  The <a href="SDK_Userguide.html#Builder">wizard builder</a> is responsible
	  for creating the wizard archive.  The builder is subclassed from
	  <a href="api/com.sun.wizards.builder.ArchiveWriter.html">ArchiveWriter</a>,
	  and must override the 
	  <a href="api/com.sun.wizards.builder.ArchiveWriter.html#createClientTree">createClientTree</a>
	  method.  The createClientTree method is responsible for constructing the wizard
	  client tree and the initialization of the WizardState object.
	  <p>
	  In practice, the ArchiveWriter subclass will also provide a main method
	  so that it can be executed from the java command line to create the
	  archive.
	  <p>
	      <p>
	      <h4><a name="Initialization of the WizardState Object">Initialization of the WizardState Object</a></h4>
	      The initialization of the WizardState object is also performed within the
	      createClientTree method of the wizard builder.  This initialization consists
	      of setting the purpose of the wizard, adding server-side objects to the
	      wizard (including Sequences and ServerObjects), and providing default values
	      where required.
	      <p>
		In this example wizard, we will set the wizard purpose (using the setPurpose
		method) and add our FilesystemServerObject to the wizard.
	<p>
	  Following is the source to the FilesystemWizardBuilder.  This code should
