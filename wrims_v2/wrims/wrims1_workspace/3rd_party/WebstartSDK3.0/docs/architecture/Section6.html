      <h1>Wizard Hierarchy</h1>
      A single wizard is designed to perform a specific task.  In some 
      wizard applications, the user might want to do several tasks at the same time.  The
      user could execute each wizard manually, one after the next.  An alternative
      to this tedious and error-prone method is to find a way to connect wizards
      together.
      <p>
	A wizard hierarchy allows multiple wizards to work together.  For example,
	one application of wizards is software installation.  Generally, an install
	wizard would be designed to install a single product. It would be nice if multiple products could be installed from the same wizard. A cdrom with four products on it could be
	installed from a single wizard in the root directory of the cdrom that
	connects four single product install wizards into one user experience.
	The wizard hierarchy preserves the user's ability to use the single product install
	wizards, as well as provide a multi-product installation solution described above.

	<p>
	On the server side, the wizard hierarchy works by instantiating a WizardState
	object for each wizard archive in the hierarchy.  Each WizardState represents
	a wizard, and facilitates access to that wizard's archive file.  There is also
	an ArchiveReader object associated with each archive in the hierarchy.  The
	root WizardState object is the WizardState associated with the wizard archive
	that was executed.  The other wizards (the ones that were not directly executed)
	are considered child wizards.  Remember that the only connection between the
	server and the client is between the root WizardState object and the
	WizardTreeManager.  Route objects are used to send messages to the appropriate
	WizardState objects.
	<p>
	On the client side, the hierarchy is a little more complicated.  The only
	wizard client tree that is loaded comes from the root wizard archive.  The
	WizardComponents within that client tree can request subtrees for display from
	the child WizardState objects.  These requests are actually sent
	to the WizardTreeManager and fulfilled by the WizardState's ArchiveReader
	object.  The subtrees can be parented by any of the WizardComponent objects in
	the wizard client tree.  Once the subtrees are added, they can be navigated and
	displayed as if they were part of the original client tree.
	<p>
	Each panel has a Route object that will route server messages to the correct
	WizardState object.  In this way, the user is oblivious that multiple wizards
	are being used to perform the task at hand.  A single user experience guides
	the setup and actions of any number of wizards.

	The structure of the wizard client tree is very important to the success of
	multiple wizards cooperating in this manner.  Nodes must exist in the parent
	wizard to provide a hook to which the child panels can be attached.  The panels
	from the child wizard that are to be displayed in the parent wizard must be
	children of a node.  The hierarchy is created through a node in the parent wizard
	reading a subtree (a node with children) from the child wizard(s) and setting
	itself as the parent of the subtree.

	The links shown in dotted lines are created at runtime.
	<p>
	Only nodes that are direct children of the
	client tree root can be read as subtrees from the archive.  Individual panels
	or nodes that are children of other non-root nodes cannot be deserialized
	directly from the wizard archive.
