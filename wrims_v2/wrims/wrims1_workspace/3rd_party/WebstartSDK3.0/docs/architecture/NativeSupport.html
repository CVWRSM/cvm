    <h1>Native Support for Wizards</h1>
    Wizards written in Java can be executed on more than
    one platform.  However, most wizards will require a lower level access to
    the operating system than pure Java provides.  For example, an install wizard
    could not properly perform its function if it were not able to register the
    installed software in the product registry.  Native support for wizards
    provides a mechanism through which this need can be met.
    <p>
      Wizard objects can use the  native support provided through the
      <a href="../api/com.sun.wizards.core.SystemInterface.html">SystemInterface</a>
      class.  This class has methods that:

<UL>
<LI>Get and set file attributes and permissions
<LI>Get partition names 
<LI>Report the amount of free space on a partition 
<LI>Get platform-specific directories (such as the standard product location or
      the temporary directory).
</UL>
      <p>
      The SystemInterface class defers the responsibility of these methods to
	another class that implements the PlatformToolkit interface.  This
	second class is platform specific.  That is, the PlatformToolkit
	class is designed specifically for one platform (or at least a 
	single type of platform), and is able to interact with the operating
	system at a level not available to pure Java code.
	<p>
	The PlatformToolkit instance must have a very specific name, so the
	factory method that instantiates it will know what platform(s) it
	supports.  For example, the PlatformToolkit that works for the Solaris
	operating system is called SolarisPlatformToolkit.  The name 
	SolarisPlatformToolkit is derived from the property "os.name"
	followed by "PlatformToolkit".  Similarly, a PlatformToolkit class
	for Windows NT might be Windows_NTPlatformToolkit (all spaces within
	the os.name property are replaced with an underscore).  However, it
	is possible on the Windows family of platforms to be able to describe
	all of them with a single PlatformToolkit object called WindowsPlatformToolkit.
	So if the more specific Windows_NTPlatformToolkit class does not exist,
	the factory method will also try the less specific WindowsPlatformToolkit
	for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT platforms.
    <p>
      Wizards can be executed on a variety of platforms, and the native support
      for wizards had to be written so that all of these platforms
      could be supported.  JNI (Java Native Interface) is the preferred mechanism
      through which platform-specific code can be executed from Java.  JNI provides
      a rich set of functions that allow the native code to interact with Java
      objects directly.
      <p>
      Unfortunately, JNI is not supported by all Java virtual machines.  For
      example, Microsoft's jview vm supports JDirect instead of JNI.  Since JDirect
      is a Microsoft technology that is not part of the Java standard, both
      JNI and JDirect technologies fail to meet the requirement that wizards
      execute on all (or at least most) platforms.
      <p>
      The technology that WebStart Wizards employ is actually an executable that
      the wizard can communicate with.  The executable is platform-specific and
      is able to perform any operation required by the wizard that cannot be accessed
      through Java.  The fact that the executable is platform-specific is no different
      than if wizards were to use JNI - this would also require a platform-specific
      shared library.  At this level, the difference between JNI and the executable
      solution is that the functions within the executable must be called using
      Java IO, and the executable has no way to create, return, or modify Java
      objects.
      <p>
	This executable is a resource of the PlatformToolkit object that can
	be used to communicate with the operating system at a level that pure
	Java does not support.  For example, the executable is used to get
	and set file permissions and attributes.
      <p>
      At buildtime, platform support is written into the wizard archive.  This
      platform-specific support includes the executable and the Java classes
      that communicate with the executable.  By default, the ArchiveWriter will
      include all platform support available.  The specific platforms can be
      specified if the wizard is intended to run on only one or two platforms.
      For example, an install wizard that installs a Windows NT product probably
      would not benefit from having Linux support built in.  The specific platform(s)
      can be selected by calling the <a href="../api/com.sun.wizards.builder.NativeSupportResourceWriter.html#setArchivePlatforms(java.util.Vector)">setArchivePlatforms</a>
      method of ArchiveWriter.
	<p>
	The support files for each platform the wizard  supports are written into
	the wizard archive.  The platform-specific executable files are referenced by
	a <a href="../api/com.sun.wizards.core.Platform.html">Platform</a>
	object that describes its target.
	<p>
	At runtime, only the executable referenced by the most specific platform
	description compatible with the runtime environment gets used.  The factory
	method for the PlatformToolkit classes instantiates the appropriate class
	and connects that through the <a href="../api/com.sun.wizards.core.SystemInterface.html">SystemInterface</a> object.
