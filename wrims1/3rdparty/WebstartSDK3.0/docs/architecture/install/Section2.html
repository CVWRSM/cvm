      <h1>Install Wizard Architecture</h1>
      The com.sun.install* package set is built on top of the WebStart Wizard
      API.  That is, install wizards have exactly the same architecture as
      WebStart wizards.  This document will describe in some detail the
      architecture of the install-specific classes.
      <p>      
      <blockquote>
	  <h5><a name="Product Tree">The Product Tree</a></h5>
	  <blockquote>
	  The product tree is a set of objects used to describe a specific product.
	  This product description consists of content as well as behavior.  The
	  product tree is responsible for the installation and removal of software.
	  The product tree is tied in to the wizard through the use of a
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.tasks.ProductTask.html">ProductTask</a>
	  Task object that is added to the install Sequence.
	  <p>
	  A product is a set of components.  For example, a simple
	  product may have two components:  Software and Documentation.  The
	  Software component might consist of one or more files (ignoring for the moment
	  the install mechanism for the content of the component) that comprise
	  the portion of the product that the user would execute.  The Documentation
	  component might consist of one or more files that comprise the information
	  describing the product and its operation.  It is conceivable that the user
	  of this installer might want the Software and Documentation
	  components installed, only the Software component installed, or only the
	  Documentation component installed.
	  <p>
	  The product tree for this simple product must be able to express the arrangement
	  of the files comprising the Software component as a single element of install.
	  The leaves of the product tree are responsible for software installation and removal.  The nodes (non-leaf objects) within the tree provide 
	  a structure to the product tree that describes the components within the
	  product.
	  <p>
	  A product tree that describes the simple product example outlined above
	  could be constructed in the following way:
	  <p>
	  <img src="productTree.gif"
	  ALT="Graphic of a simple product tree."
	  ALIGN=center HSPACE=10 VSPACE=7>
	  <p>
	  The leaves of the product tree are responsible for installing and removing
	   files.  The objects representing the leaves of the product trees are called
          Units.  The specific Unit class used must correspond to the install mechanism
	  that will be used to lay down the bits.  
	  <p>
	  For example, the correct mechanism to install bits on the Solaris operating
	  system is the command pkgadd.  Within the com.sun.install.products package,
	  there is a <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.products.PkgUnit.html">PkgUnit</a>
	  class that performs a pkgadd command to install software from an SVR4
	  package, and performs a pkgrm command to remove the software at uninstall
	  time.
	  <p>
	  On operating systems that do not use SVR4 packages (for example, Microsoft Windows),
	  files are simply moved onto the file system and registered in the Registry.
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.products.FileUnit.html">FileUnit</a>
	  is the class that handles this sort of installation.
	  <p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <h5><a name="Product Tree Dependencies">Dependencies Within the Product Tree</a></h5>
      <blockquote>
	  As described in the previous section, nodes within the product tree
	  are used to group Unit objects into components.  Nodes can also be
	  used to omit product components from the installation.
	  <p>
	  A product that supports more than one platform may have components or
	  files within a specific component that should not be installed on all
	  platforms.  For example, a product supporting the Solaris operating system
	  both for the Sparc and Intel platforms should not install the Sparc-specific
	  files or components if the installer is running on an Intel platform.  This
	  is an example of a dependency within the product tree.  
	  Parts of this example product tree depend on the platform on which the
	  installer is executed.
	  <p>
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.products.PlatformDependency.html">
	  PlatformDependency</a> is a subclass of InstallNode that only allows
	  its child components or leaves to be installed if a platform condition
	  is met.  This platform condition is specified within the wizard builder
	  that creates the install archive.
	  <p>
	  The simple example presented earlier will be expanded on to  demonstrate the use of the PlatformDependency class. The product being installed
	  works on both Solaris Sparc and Solaris Intel platforms.  This dual
	  platform support is achieved through a duplication of binary files.  One
	  set of binary files works on Solaris Sparc; the other set works on
	  Solaris Intel.  There are two ways in which this dependency could
	  be expressed within the product tree.
	  <p>
	  The first expression of the platform dependency example assumes that
	  the binaries that are platform-specific comprise the set of files
	  within the Software component.  In this case, we might create
	  two components which install the Software binaries, as shown in the
	  following diagram:
	  <p>
	  <img src="productDependency1.gif"
	  ALT="Graphic of a simple product tree with dependencies."
	  ALIGN=center HSPACE=10 VSPACE=7>
	  <p>
	  The second expression of the platform dependency example considers
	  that there may be some unneccessary duplication between the Software
	  component for Solaris-Sparc and the Software component for
	  Solaris-Intel.  This duplication may include configuration files,
	  images, audio clips, or other files that work on both platforms.  
	  The executables and shared libraries are the parts of the Software
	  component that the dependency should affect.  This will result in
	  only one Software component that consists of leaves for the specific
	  platforms, and a common unit with contents that work on both platforms.
	  Following is a diagram that demonstrates this strategy.
	  <p>
	  <img src="productDependency2.gif"
	  ALT="Graphic of a simple product tree with dependencies."
	  ALIGN=center HSPACE=10 VSPACE=7>
	  <p>
	  The platform dependency is only one example in which sections of the
	  product tree should be omitted.  Other dependencies are possible.  Dependency
	  classes can be created to key off almost any attribute of the runtime
	  environment by subclassing 
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.products.InstallNode.html">InstallNode</a>
	  and overriding the updateDependency method.
	      <p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <h5><a name="Install Client Tree">Install Client Tree</a></h5>
      <blockquote>
		The install <a href="../../SDK_Userguide.html#Client Tree">client tree</a>
		defines the set of panels the user experiences during a product installation.  Though the developer of an install wizard is free to define
		any client tree with the Web Start SDK,  developers 
are encouraged to
		use the client tree designed with the SDK.
		<p>
		The install client tree described in this section is the one demonstrated in
		the SampleBuilder.  This client tree makes installation easier by
		not requiring the user to enter any information if the default settings
		are acceptable.  This suits the needs of novice users, by not requiring them
		to manipulate (or even see) every setting in order to install the software.
		For the advanced user, the install client tree presents additional panels to
		allow the user more control over the installation.  		<p>
		The install client tree consists of an ordered arrangement of nodes and panels
		that are designed to guide the user through a product installation.
		<p>
		The following diagram depicts the install client tree:
		<p>
	  </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
		<img src="clientTree.gif"
		  ALT="Graphic of install client tree."
		  ALIGN=center HSPACE=10 VSPACE=7>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
		<p>
		In this diagram, the rectangles depict nodes, subclassed from
		<a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardComposite.html">WizardComposite</a>, and
		the ovals depict the panels, subclassed from
		<a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardLeaf.html">WizardLeaf</a>
	  <p>
	  The nodes within the client tree are not displayed.  They are present to
	  express navigation behavior.  Each panel and node within the tree can
	  choose to be visible or invisible, based on the return value of the
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardComponent.html#skip">skip</a>
	  method.  If a panel's skip method returns true, that panel is not
	  displayed.  If a node's skip method returns true, that node's child
	  panels is not displayed.  In this way, a wizard can provide "extra" panels
	  that novice users will not see.
	  <p>
	  The <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.panels.WelcomePanel.html">WelcomePanel</a>
	  within the install client tree is the first panel displayed within the wizard.
	  This panel's purpose is to indicate the purpose of the wizard and set the 
	  expectations of the user.  The WelcomePanel displays a brief message indicating
	  what product will be installed by this wizard.  This allows the user to verify
	  that the correct wizard was executed.  This panel is for display only. No
	  information is collected from the user or set into the 
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardState.html">WizardState</a>
	  object during its execution.  The user has the opportunity to exit during 
	  the WelcomePanel.
	  <p>
	  The 
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.panels.GroupedInstallTypePanel.html">GroupedInstallTypePanel</a>
	  is provided to allow the user to select a "Typical" installation or a "Custom" installation.
	  If the user selects a Typical installation, the wizard will not display panels that
	  query the user for customizations.  Instead, default values will be used.  The user 
	  has the option to go back to this panel and select Custom if they find a need
	  to customize some aspect of the installation.  If the user selects a Custom installation,
	  more panels will be displayed to the user prompting for information such as the install
	  location and the specific product components the user wishes to install.  The
	  GroupedInstallTypePanel sets a value in the
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardState.html">WizardState</a> object that
	  indicates the user's selection.  This selection may be read by either client object
	  or server objects.
	  <p>
	  The <a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.nodes.SkipNode.html">SkipNode</a> labeled
	  "custom" displays its child panels only if the Custom button was selected
	  on the 
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.panels.GroupedInstallTypePanel.html">GroupedInstallTypePanel</a>
	  .  This is accomplished by overriding the
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardComponent.html#skip">skip</a> method, which
	  looks at a value within the WizardState object to determine whether or not to skip its children.
	  Within the install builder, this SkipNode object is wired to the same value as the
	  GroupedInstallTypePanel.
	  <p>
	  The 
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.panels.DirectorySelectionPanel.html">DirectorySelectionPanel</a>
	  Is only displayed during a Custom installation.  This panel enables the user to change
	  the location in which the software will be installed.  The default install location is
	  displayed in a java.awt.TextField object.  When the user presses the Next button at
	  the bottom of the wizard frame, the location within the TextField object is saved in
	  the WizardState.
	  <p>
	  The
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.panels.ComponentPanel.html">ComponentPanel</a>
	  is only displayed during a Custom installation.  This panel enables the user to select
	  which component(s) of the product will be installed.  The components are displayed as
	  java.awt.Checkbox objects.  The default components will be on when the panel first displays.
	  The user can modify the list of components to install by selecting or deselecting
	  the Checkbox associated with each product component.  When the Next button at the
	  bottom of the wizard frame is pressed, the list of selected components is saved in the
	  WizardState.
	  <p>
	  The
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.panels.VerifyPanel.html">VerifyPanel</a> performs disk
	  space checking and allows the user to view the install settings before the installation proceeds.
	  If not enough disk space was found, the user is notified on this panel.  The VerifyPanel is
	  the last panel from which the user can go back to make corrections to the install settings
	  before installation.  Once the user presses the Install Now button, the installation
	   proceeds.
	  <p>
	  The 
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardComposite.html">WizardComposite</a>
	  labeled "preinstall" is used to present panels specific to the preinstallation of the
	  product or its components.  This node is optional, and should only be included if
	  your product has a panel to display prior to installation.  One possible use of this
	  preinstall node is to support a panel that uses a task to perform checking
	  before the product is installed.  For example if the product is a web server and a different
	  webserver is already installed and running on the system, a child panel of the
	  preinstall node could warn the user and give them the option to install anyway, or to
	  skip the installation of the webserver.
	  <p>
	  The
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.panels.ProgressPanel.html">ProgressPanel</a>
	  displays install progress to the user.  When this panel is displayed, it initiates
	  a <a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.core.Sequence.html">Sequence</a> that 
	  installs the product.  The install sequence contains a 
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.tasks.ProductTask.html">ProductTask</a> that
	  sends a message to the <a href="#Product Tree">Product Tree</a> to install the product.
	  When the product installation is complete, the next panel in the install client tree
	  is displayed automatically.
	  <p>
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardComposite.html">WizardComposite</a>
	  labeled "postinstall" is used to present panels specific to the postinstallation of the
	  product or its components.  This node is optional, and should only be included if
	  your product has a panel to display after installation.  One possible use of this
	  postinstall node is initial product configuration.  For example, if the product being
	  installed is a webserver, this panel might be used to enable the user to select the
	  default port number.
	  <p>
	  The
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.panels.SummaryPanel.html">SummaryPanel</a> is used
	  to indicate installation status to the user.  The SummaryPanel indicates
	  "Installed" if the product installation was successful.  If the installation failed, this
	  panel will indicate "Failed."  Log information describing the nature of the failure
	  is accessable from this panel.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      <h5><a name="Install Hierarchy">Install Hierarchy</a></h5>
      <blockquote>
	The install client tree shown in the previous section works well for a single
	product installation.  This tree does not address multiple product installation.
	Use an install hierarchy for this purpose.  
	<p>
	  The install hierarchy is a set of install wizards that are designed to work together
	  to install more than one product.  The user will execute the topmost wizard. 
	  The lower-level product wizards will have some of their panels displayed in the
	  upper-level wizard's frame.
	  <p>
	  The construction of the install hierarchy mirrors that of software development.  In
	  software development a team of engineers is responsible for the creation of a
	  suite of software to be released on a compact disk (CD).  That team of engineers
	  is usually broken into groups.  Each group within the team is responsible for a
	  single product within the suite.  Similarly, each group within the team would create
	  a product install wizard that is responsible for installing their piece.  The CD
	  is usually created by a release engineer who interacts with each of the groups
	  to get their installable bits.  Among those bits is the installer for those
	  bits.  There would be an install wizard for each product on the CD.  The release
	  engineer would create a CD-level install wizard that connects all of the 
	  product-level install wizards into a single user experience.
	  <p>
	  The CD-level install wizard has an install client tree similar to that of the
	  product-level install wizards discussed in the previous section.
	<p>
	  </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
	  <img src="CDClientTree.gif"
	    ALT="Graphic of CD-level install client tree."
	    ALIGN=center HSPACE=10 VSPACE=7>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
	<p>
	  The WelcomePanel, GroupedInstallTypePanel, VerifyPanel, and SummaryPanel are the
	  same panels as in the single product install wizard discussed in the previous section.
	  The only difference is that the VeryfyPanel and SummaryPanel will report all of the
	  products selected for installation, rather than just a single product.
	  <p>
	  The <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.panels.ProductPanel.html">ProductPanel</a>
	  presents the user with a list of products that can be installed using this CD-level
	  wizard.  The list contains the name of the product followed by three radio buttons.
	  With the radio buttons, the user can choose not to install that product, to perform
	  a "Typical" installation of that product, or to perform a "Custom" installation
	  of that product.
	  <p>
	  The <a href="../../api/com.sun.install.nodes.CustomNode.html">CustomNode</a> is
	  different than the one used within the product
	  install client tree.  The CustomNode reads the custom subtrees from the product-level
	  install wizards.  This is only done for each product selected for a "Custom"
	  installation within the ProductPanel.  The effect is that custom panels from
	  the product-level install wizards will follow the display of the ProductPanel.
	  After all of the products selected for Custom installation have had their
	  custom panels displayed, the VerifyPanel is shown.
	  <p>
	  The nodes labeled "preinstall", "install", and "postinstall" are of class
	  <a href="../../api/com.sun.wizards.nodes.HierarchyNode.html">HierarchyNode</a>.
	  The HierarchyNode reads and displays the subtree of the same name from all
	  child wizards that have been selected.  For example, the HierarchyNode labeled
	  install will read the subtree rooted by a noded named install from each
	  selected child wizard.  This has the effect of displaying the product-level
	  ProgressPanel within the CD-level installer.
