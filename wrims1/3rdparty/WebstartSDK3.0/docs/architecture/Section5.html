      <h1>Client-Server Communication</h1>
      Client objects must have access to data stored within the server.  Often,
      panels will display information saved in the WizardState or indicate
      current settings that the server will use to perform its action.
      <p>
	The only channel of communication between the server and the client
	is between the WizardTreeManager and the root WizardState objects.
	This communication link enables client objects (panels, nodes, the
	WizardTreeManager) to call server object methods.  The use of the
	Mediator design pattern on both the client and the server eliminates
	the requirement of multiple object references between the client and
	the server.  As we will see in <a href="Section7.html">Remote 	
	Wizards</a>, this is a vital
	property of client-server communication that makes a remote client
	possible.
	<p>
	The WizardTreeManager maintains a reference to a WizardState object.
	This object reference points to the root WizardState and can be used
	directly by the WizardTreeManager.  Other objects within the client have
	access to the WizardState object and its methods through calls to the
	WizardTreeManager.callServerObjectMethod method.  This method uses
	reflection to invoke the specified method.
	<p>
	Similarly, the WizardState object maintains a reference to the
	WizardTreeManager.  The server has a method, WizardState.callClientObjectMethod, that is able to call object
	methods in the client.  
	<p>
	Reflection is a scheme in which an object method may be invoked at
	runtime by knowing the method name and argument list.
	Ordinarily, the calling object is compiled against the target object,
	and any error in the method use is caught at compile time.
	Reflection defers linking and error checking until runtime, allowing a
	loose binding between the calling object and the target object.  
	<p>
	The Java reflection API requires a reference to the target object, which presents a problem with the wizard architecture.  It is not
	possible for a client panel to retrieve a reference to a server-side
	object.  This is to avoid multiple points of contact between
	the server and client.  To get the message to the correct
	object, a routing object is used.  
	<p>
	The Route is an object that contains information that directs messages
	to the correct object.  Each panel in the client panel tree has its own
	Route object.  Each WizardState in the server WizardState tree has its
	own route.  Each panel's Route object routes server messages to the
	correct WizardState object.  Server objects do not call client objects
	unless the client object being called sends its Route object to the server.
	<p>
	Through the routing mechanism and calls to callServerObjectMethod, the
	client panels can call virtually any WizardState method without violating
	the client/server model. The client
	objects must not call any method or use any object that could not be used
	within a web browser.  If that rule is broken, the wizard will only be
	able to work locally.
