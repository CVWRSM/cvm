      <h3><a name="Webstart Wizards on Windows">1. Introduction: Webstart Install Wizards on Windows</a></h3>
      <blockquote>
	  It is easy to create a Webstart Install Wizard for
	  installing products on Windows. Many products targeted for
	  Windows are complex and involve installation, configuration,
	  and testing.  Through the use of a Webstart Wizard, you can
	  be sure that your product will get installed correctly and
	  easily, without any confusion.  
	  <p>
            You can create a <em>product tree</em> of Files, Start Menu
            Icons, READMEs, etc,
	    and have the Wizard install using this tree as a description
	    of what to install.  Your tree can be built to be architecture-independent,
	    so that it works on all operating system implementations, regardless of the architecture
	    of the underlying machine.
      </blockquote>
      <h3><a name="How to package">2. How should I package my product?</h3>
      <blockquote>
	  For building wizards on Windows, your product is most likely a
          set of files and directories.  Your product's files will be placed
          inside the wizard, along with the graphical support, ready to be
          shipped elsewhere.
	<p>
	You will be using the <a href="../../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.FileUnit.html"><code>FileUnit</code></a> class to represent
        collections of files within your product tree.  This class can install sets of files into different places,
        depending on how you configure your product tree.
	  <p>
          You can even
	  write support for your own custom types of files using the Wizard
	  API (see the <a href="../../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.InstallLeaf.html">InstallLeaf</a>
	  API).  See <a
	  href="../src/WindowsBuilder.java">WindowsBuilder.java</a>
	  for the source code to this sample.
		<p>
	<em>This example only covers the file collection approach (standalone files)</em>.
      </blockquote>
	  <p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><h5><a name="Standalone">Products with standalone files</a></h5> 
	  Use this method if the files of your product
	  are not packaged in any predefined format, such as Solaris
	  Packages, Zip files, tar files, etc.  When you create your
	  wizard, the files you specify will be gathered up and placed
	  into the archive (by using the <a href="../../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.FileUnit.html"><code>FileUnit</code></a> class).  You can define any directory structure
	  you want, so that the files get written to their correct
	  destination directories when the wizard is run.  You might
	  also use this for miscellaneous files, such as READMEs, help
	  files, or other files that do not belong anywhere else.  In
	  fact, this is the method used to write the entire Webstart
	  Wizard SDK (see <a href="../../generic/src/WebstartSDKBuilder.java">WebstartSDKBuilder.java</a>,
	  the code used to create the SDK you have just installed).
	  <p>
	  <li><h5><a name="System Dependencies">Products with System Environment Dependencies</h5>
          Used for products which require certain conditions before
          they can be installed.  Example conditions might include a
          check of the processor type, a check for the Sun JDK
          installed on the system, or any other measurable variable.
          The WindowsBuilder below uses product tree
          dependencies.  Another way to check dependencies is during
          initialization of the wizard, by adding a dependency <em>task</em> to the
          initialization Sequence (via <code>addInitializationTask()</code> within
          your builder).
          <p>
	  <li><h5><a name="PrePost-Install">Products Which Required
	  Pre- or Post-Installation Configuration</h5> Many products
	  might require extra customization before or after
	  installation, over and above the standard <code>"Product
	  Installation Directory:"</code> question.  With wizards, you
	  can create a series of user interface panels that gather
	  user customization information that you use to affect the
	  outcome of the install.  Or, you could have a series of
	  panels that customizes the product <em>after</em>
	  installation, without the user having to go edit text files,
	  or run other utilities to finish the installation and
	  configuration of the product.  You can then install these panels
	  within the panel sequence of your wizard to present to the user
	  before or after installation.  There is an API to add these panels
	  in the Wizard API, see the WindowsBuilder below for an 
	  example of a pre-install panel.
	  <p>
	  <li><h5><a name="CDROM">Layout Out Your Product on a CD-ROM</a></h5> 
          A good layout can help the user install the CD more
          easily. Suggesting a common layout for CDs also helps the
          user find files of interest from CD to CD and helps a
          company build a well-organized CD for global
          localization. Note the top level directory is kept
          simple. In a graphical context, this aids the user in finding the
          installer icon quickly and "double clicking" it to start the
          Web Start install.  Or, if your product will mainly be installed
          on Windows, you might want to add a <code>autorun.inf</code> file to
          the root directory of the CD-ROM, so that the installer automatically
          launches when the CD-ROM is inserted into the CD-ROM drive.
           <p>
          For your product(s), you could use the 
          following directory layout when organizing your product on a CD-ROM:
      <p>
	<img src="images/CDFilesystem.gif" ALT="Picture of a CD-ROM Filesystem Layout" BORDER=0>
      <p>
	  The top-level <strong>.install</strong> directory contains a
	  CD-level wizard that is capable of presenting a single
	  install for all of the products on the CD.  In addition, the
	  <code>autorun.inf</code> file is located in the root
	  directory, which should run the install wizard.  This is
	  provided so that Windows can easily locate and run the
	  install. There is also a <code>setup.bat</code> file in the root directory that is
          runnable by double-clicking on it, in case the user has disabled the <strong>autorun</strong>
          feature of Windows. 
	<p>
	  Each of the {<strong>product1</strong>,
	  <strong>product2</strong>, <strong>. . . .</strong>,
	  <strong>productN</strong>} directories contains all of the
	  products to be installed with the CD-level installer, along
	  with supporting files.  Supporting files include another
	  <code>setup.bat</code> batch file that runs the
	  product-level install (a wizard that only installs one
	  product), the install wizard itself, and the supporting
	  localized resources.
	<p>
	  You should use this layout for all CDs you install with Web Start Wizards.
	<p>
	  <li><h5><a name="PackageTogether">Putting it all together</a></h5>
	  In summary, your product can consist of virtually any combination of types
	  of files.  For file types that are not included in the Wizard SDK, java
	  classes can be written and used in order to support them.  See the <a href=
	    "../../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.InstallLeaf.html">InstallLeaf</a> API
	  documentation for details on creating and installing your own types of files.
	</ul>
	  <h3><a name="Code">3. What Code Do I Need To Write?</h3>
      <blockquote>
	For simple install wizards, the only thing you need to write is the <em>builder</em>
	  code.  This is where you will specify the files that comprise your product.  You
	  can also customize various aspects of the install, such as the "About..." message
	  contents, the exit warning, etc.  The rest of the install is written for you in the
	  InstallArchiveWriter superclass. A basic set of panels are provided for your wizard.
	  The panel sequence is as follows:
          <ul>
	    <li>1. Welcome (With optional "About..." Dialog)
	    <li>2. Install Type ("Typical" or "Custom") 
	    <li>3. Locale Selection (if the user selected a "Custom" install) 
	    <li>4. Directory Selection (if the user selected a "Custom" install) 
	    <li>5. Component Selection (if the user selected a "Custom" install) 
	    <li>6. Verify Panel (Shows user what they selected)
	    <li>7. Progress Panel (product actually gets installed here)
	    <li>8. Summary Panel (shows results)
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    For more complex installs, you would need to build your
	    product tree yourself, as well customizing the wizard panel tree.
	    This is what we will be doing in the WindowsBuilder
	    below.  The basic steps to creating a wizard are:
	    <ul>
	    <li>1. Creating a development environment, 
	    <li>2. Writing a builder, 
	    <li>3. Creating pre- and post-installation configuration panels, and then 
	    <li>4. Compiling and running your builder to produce the wizard.
	      </ul>
	    <p>
	    </blockquote>
	    <ul>
	    <li><h5><a name="CodeDevEnv">Creating a Development Environment</a></h5> 
            For developing wizards, a Sun JDK 1.1-compliant compiler is required.
            <p>
            It is recommended that you put any of your
	    supporting java <code>.class</code> files in a separate
	    package from the Webstart Wizards SDK classes.  You
	    should, however, include the Webstart Wizards SDK classes
	    in your <code>CLASSPATH</code> setting.  An example 
             directory structure that might be used is:
      <pre>
      classes
        --> com
            ---> sun
                 ---> wizards 
                        ---> awt
                        ---> core
                        ---> panels
                        ---> nodes
                        ---> builder
                        ---> rmi
                 ---> install
                        ---> products
                        ---> panels
                        ---> tasks
                        ---> nodes
            ---> companyName
                       ------> install
                                 ---> builders
                                 ---> panels
                                 ---> tasks
                                 ---> {other types}
</pre>
      You would then include the 'classes' directory in your <code>CLASSPATH</code> and
      import your customized classes with <code><strong>import com.companyName.install.panels.*;</strong></code>
      within your java code.
      <p>
      As an example, suppose you write a builder and place it in the <code>com.companyName.install.builders</code>
      package and name it <code>MyBuilder.java</code>.  To compile it, you would put the 'classes'
      directory in your <code>CLASSPATH</code> and type:
      <pre>
	<strong>javac com.companyName.install.builders.MyBuilder.java</strong>
      </pre>
      Then, assuming it wrote your wizard to the current directory and
      called it <code>install.class</code>, you would type <strong><code>java
	install</code></strong> to run your wizard.
      <p>
	    <li><h5><a name="CodeBuilder">Writing the Builder</a></h5>
      The builder is the part that ties all of the various pieces of the installation together and
      writes out the resulting <code>.class</code> file for distribution. All builders (whether custom or not)
      use the same basic skeleton builder to begin with:
      <pre>
      public class SkeletonBuilder extends InstallArchiveWriter
      {

        public SkeletonBuilder()
         {
           super();
         }

        protected void createClientTree()
         {
           super.createClientTree();

            /*
             * Customize your builder here
             */

         }

        public static void main(String[] args)
         {
           SkeletonBuilder myBuilder = new SkeletonBuilder();
           myBuilder.writeArchive();
         }
      }
      </pre>
      You can then add extra code in the <code>createClientTree()</code> method to customize your
      wizard.  
      <p>
	In your builder's createClientTree() method, you can include calls to customize some or all
	of your wizard, using InstallArchiveWriter's API provided.  See the
	<a href="../../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.InstallArchiveWriter.html">InstallArchiveWriter</a> API for
	details of the methods available.  Some of the things you can customize are:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>What happens at wizard initialization time.
	<li>The name of the product.
	<li>The "About..." Message.  When the user clicks on the "About" button on the Welcome Panel, this message
	  is shown.  
	<li>The "Exit" Message.  When the user clicks on the "Exit" button before the wizard is finished installing,
	  this message is displayed.  You might want to warn the user about exiting too early.
	<li>The "Cancel" Message.  If the user cancels one of your sequences, this message is displayed.  An example of
	  when the "Cancel" button appear would be during installation.  All currently running sequences are paused while
	  the user verifies the button press.
	<li>The default installation directory.
	<li>The name of the resulting archive class filename.
	<li>The image displayed during the lifetime of the wizard.
	<li>The image displayed when the wizard is iconified.
      </ul>
      <p>
	<li><h5><a name="CodePanels">Creating Pre- and
	  Post-Installation User Interface Panels</a></h5> 
      If your
      product needs any pre-installation or post-installation
      configuration, you can write panels that will be
      displayed at the appropriate times during your
      installation, and interact with the server to make the
      configurations. Once written, you can place these panel sequences
      into the client panel tree in your builder using the
      <code>addNode()</code> method of
      InstallArchiveWriter.  A sample pre-installation
      configuration panel is used in the WindowsBuilder
      below to configure the port number for the web server.
      <p>
	You should place your
      panel classes within <em>your</em> section of the development environment,
      separate from any Wizards SDK classes, and include the panels
      into your builder. 
	<p>For example, suppose I have created a
      pre-configuration panel called "PreconfigurePanel.java" that prompts
      for the <code>bin</code> directory of the system. I have
      placed the panel in the com.sun.myCompany.panels package.  In my builder, I might
      include this panel as a pre-configuration panel by doing the following:
      <pre>
      import com.sun.myCompany.panels.*;
      [...]
      PreconfigurePanel myPanel = new PreconfigurePanel("\\bin");
      addNode(myPanel, PREINSTALL);
      </pre>
      This panel will then be shown to the user before installation.  It is the panel's
      responsiblility to correctly configure the system based on user input.
      <p>
	In the example below, the web server is, by default, set to serve web pages from the <code>public_html</code>
        directory. We
	create a <em>post-install</em> panel that takes user input specifying the directory to use.
        Then create a task and call your task from the panel.
	The task will reconfigure the web server.
	In this way, you can configure the product after it has installed. 
      <p>
      <li><h5><a name="CodeTogether">Putting it all together</a></h5>
      In summary, for simple installations, only the builder needs to
      be written.  It can be as simple or as complex as you want. For
      more complex installations, the features of InstallArchiveWriter
      can be used to create a fully-cusomized wizard that does
      installation and configuration for your product.  For a complete
      example, go through the next section which presents a real-world
      example and walks you through the entire process of creating a
      customized wizard for a fictional product.
      </ul>
      <h3><a name="WindowsBuilder">4. Windows Step-By-Step Example: WindowsBuilder.java</h3>
      <blockquote>
	  The following example builds a fictional product that
	  consists of a set of files, and a start menu entry.  The java source
          code will only be installed if the user is running Windows NT.
	    <p>
	    </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li><h5><a name="Sample Files">Sample Files Involved</a></h5>
      This demo features the following files:
      <p>
      <ul>
	<li>A Windows NT Platform Dependency.
	<li>The files in the <a href="../testfiles"><code>[SDK Base Directory]\samples\windows\testfiles</code></a> directory of the Webstart Wizards SDK.
      </ul>
      <p>
      These files are the ones you would have to provide if you were to build and distribute this product.
	<p><hr>
	<li><h3><a name="Step 1">Step 1:Laying out the product tree</a></h3> 
      <p> 
        The product tree is the internal wizard representation of your product.  It has nothing to do
        with the way the product files are organized on disk.  The product tree is built at <em>buildtime</em>
	and then used to install at <em>installtime</em> (also known as  <em>runtime</em>).
	<p>
        We first decide how we want to ship our product.
	We know we have to install our
	product, but only install the java demos if the user is using Windows NT.
        Otherwise, the component will not appear on the component selection screen.
      <p>
	Therefore, our product tree conceptually looks like this:
      <center><h2>Product Tree </h2></center>
      <strong><pre>

                              [PRODUCT]
                                  |
     +----------------------------+-------------------------------+
     |                            |                               |
[Binary Files]*           [Documentation]*             [WinNT Dependency]
     |                            |                               |
     |                            |                               |
 [BinFiles]                  [DocFiles]                       [JavaFiles]*

	<li><h3><a name="Step 2">Step 2:Begin the Builder</a></h3> 
      We will create a skeleton builder, then add pieces into it until
      we have finished.  Begin your builder by writing this simple
      builder that doesn't do anything into a file called
      <code>WindowsBuilder.java</code> in the Web Start Wizards SDK
      <strong>"classes"</strong> directory:

      <strong><pre>
import com.sun.install.panels.*;
import com.sun.install.products.*;
import com.sun.wizards.builder.resolver.*;
import com.sun.wizards.core.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;

public class WindowsBuilder extends InstallArchiveWriter
{
  public WindowsBuilder()
  {
    super();
  } 
  
  protected void createClientTree()
  {
     super.createClientTree();

    /*
     * Customization code goes here
     */
  }

  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
     WindowsBuilder sampleBuilder = new WindowsBuilder();
     sampleBuilder.writeArchive();
     System.exit(0);
  }

}
      </pre></strong>
      <p>
	This class extends <code>InstallArchiveWriter</code> so that we can use some of its
	convenience methods created for making <em>install</em> wizards.  We also override
	<code>createClientTree()</code> because this is where we are going to make our wizard
	do something instead of not doing anything.
	<p>
	You can compile and run this class if you wish.  To compile it, type:
	<strong><pre>
c:\sdk\classes> javac WindowsBuilder.java
        </pre></strong>
        Do not type the <code>c:\sdk\classes></code>.  That is an indication of a command prompt.  
        To run the resulting class, type:
        <strong><pre>
c:\sdk\classes> java WindowsBuilder
</pre></strong>
      It will complain:
      <strong><pre>
Nothing to do: No components added, quitting...
</pre></strong>
      This is because we have not added any components, and could not create an installation wizard.
      These tasks come next.<p>
      <hr><li><h3><a name="Step 3">Step 3: Set the Product Name and Default Directory</a></h3> 
      Add this code to the <code>createClientTree()</code> method:
      <strong><pre>
setProductName("My Windows Sample Web Server");
setDefaultDirectory("[userDir]\\http");
      </pre></strong>
<font size=-3>* NOTE: The double backslash (<code>\\</code>) is required to escape the normal meaning of the backslash character.</font><p><p>
      The <code>[userDir]</code> key in the second line gets replaced at runtime with the "home" directory for the user
      that is running the wizard.  There are other substitutions one could do:
      <p>
      <ul>
	  <li><code>[productDir]</code> = Standard install directory (usually <code>[WINDIR]\Program Files</code> on Windows)
	  <li><code>[sharedLibDir]</code> = Shared Library directory (usually <code>[WINDIR]\system</code> on Windows)
	  <li><code>[tmpDir]</code> = Temporary scratch directory (usually <code>[WINDIR]\temp</code> on Windows)
          <li><code>[currentDir]</code> = Current directory
	  </li>
      </ul>
      <hr><li><h3><a name="Step 4">Step 4: Set the Name of the Images to Display</a></h3> 
      Add this code to the <code>createClientTree()</code> method:
      <strong><pre>
setImage("com.sun.install.install");
      </pre></strong>
      The <code>com.sun.install.install</code> specification means that the image exists in the <code>com/sun/install</code>
      directory relative to your <code>CLASSPATH</code> (or current directory if no class path is set), and is called
      install.gif, install.jpg, install.jpeg, or install.jfif.  You must also make sure that your image gets put into the archive
      by configuring a FileResolver to get the image, and adding the image to a ResourceCollection so that it gets resolved and put into the archive. 

      To do this, add this code to the <code>createClientTree()</code> method:

      <strong><pre>
FileResolver resolver = new FileResolver(System.getProperty("java.class.path"));
ResourceCollection collection = new ResourceCollection();
collection.addResource("Images", "com.sun.install.install", resolver);
addCollection(collection);
     </pre></strong>
      <hr><li><h3><a name="Step 5">Step 5: Set Any Configurable Messages</a></h3> 
      Add this code to the <code>createClientTree()</code> method:
<strong><pre>
setAboutMsg(new Msg("com.sun.install.Install", "AboutText"));
setCancelMsg(new Msg("com.sun.install.Install", "CancelAreYouSure"));
setExitMsg(new Msg("com.sun.install.Install", "ExitAreYouSure"));
</pre></strong> 
      This sets some configurable messages. If you do not specify an
      "About..." message, then the about button will not be displayed
      on the Welcome Panel.  The others will default to default
      values.  The About message is displayed when the user clicks the
      "About" button on the Welcome Panel.  The Cancel message is
      displayed when the user cancels some operation such as install
      or disk space checking, by clicking the "Cancel" button.  The
      Exit Message displays when the user clicks the "Exit" button.
      <p>
	Note that these messages are localized. At runtime, the
	specified locale resource bundle is searched according to the
	runtime locale.  In this case the resource bundle "com.sun.install.Install" will
	be searched for a message corresponding to the supplied keys. 
      <hr><li><h3><a name="Step 6">Step 6:Build the Product Components</a></h3> 
      Add this code to the <code>createClientTree()</code> method:
      <strong><pre>
SoftwareComponent binaries = new SoftwareComponent(new Msg("Binary Files"));
SoftwareComponent documentation = new SoftwareComponent(new Msg("Documentation"));
SoftwareComponent NTjavademos = new SoftwareComponent(new Msg("NT Java Demos"));
</pre></strong>
A SoftwareComponent represents a node in the product tree that can show
up on the ComponentPanel as selectable by the user.  
<p>
Each one is given a name that will appear to the user on the Component
Selection screen.    
<p>
<hr><li><h3><a name="Step 7">Step 7:Create a Platform Object</a></h3>
      Add this code to the <code>createClientTree()</code> method:
<pre><strong>
Platform ntPlatform = new Platform(Platform.WINDOWS, Platform.WINNT, Platform.ALL);
</pre></strong>
This object represents a specific platform (Microsoft WindowsNT, running on any architecture).  This object
can be used to build <i>Platform Dependencies</i>.  See the API Documentation for instructions on how
to specify your own platform.
<hr><li><h3><a name="Step 8">Step 8:Create Platform Dependencies</a></h3>
      Add this code to the <code>createClientTree()</code> method:
      <pre><strong>
PlatformDependency ntDependency = new PlatformDependency(ntPlatform, false);
      </pre></strong>
These Platform Dependencies are objects inserted into the product tree.
They compare the the supplied Platform object to the current platform and
"fail" if they do not match.  You can also <em>invert</em> The dependency,
meaning it will "pass" when the dependency "fails", by passing <code>true</code>
as the second argument to the constructor.
<p>
These will be checked just before the
installation takes place, and if the platforms do not match up, they
will not install anything that is attached in the tree below that
object.
<p>
You can create your own custom Dependency by creating a class that
extends <strong><code>com.sun.install.products.InstallNode</code></strong> and
implement the <code>refresh()</code> method.  The <code>refresh()</code>
method should set the <code>nodeIsActive</code> property to <code>true</code> if
the dependency is <code>true</code>.  Then you can insert your new Dependency into the
tree just as we have done here.
<p>
The <a href="../../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.SunJDKDependency.html"><code>SunJDKDependency</code></a> is 
an example of how this might be done.  You create one by passing the
version of the Sun JDK you are looking for.  It has the following refresh()
method:
<pre>
public boolean refresh(Vector targets, String sharedPoolKey)
  {
    RunCmd versionCheck = new RunCmd("java -version", true);
    String result = versionCheck.getAllOutput();
    if ((result != null) && (isCompatible(result))
      {
        nodeIsActive = !invert;
      }
    else
      {
        nodeIsActive = false;
      }
  }
</pre>
<p>
The <code>isCompatible()</code> method simply checks to see if the two version strings are compatible,
and is irrelevent to this topic.
<p>
Note that if the <code>invert</code> flag (a flag within the class) is <code>true</code> we
must <em>invert</em> the output; that is, set nodeIsActive to the opposite of what we would
normally set it to.


<hr><li><h3><a name="Step 9">Step 9: Create File Components</a></h3>
      Add this code to the <code>createClientTree()</code> method:
<pre><strong>
FileUnit binFiles = new FileUnit("Bin Files");
binFiles.addFile("..\\samples\\windows\\testfiles", "binfiles", null);
addCollection(binFiles.getCollection());

FileUnit docFiles = new FileUnit("Doc Files");
docFiles.addFile("..\\samples\\windows\\testfiles", "docfiles", null);
addCollection(docFiles.getCollection());

FileUnit javaFiles = new FileUnit("Java Files");
javaFiles.addFile("..\\samples\\windows\\testfiles", "javafiles", null);
addCollection(javaFiles.getCollection());
</pre></strong>
<font size=-1><em>NOTE: The relative paths above assume that you are running this code from the</em> <code>classes</code> <em> directory of the Web Start Wizards SDK.</em></font>
<p>
For each File collection, you must declare which files it will install (by using
the <code>addFile()</code> API of FileUnit), and then add those files to the archive 
via the <code>addCollection()</code> API of <code>InstallArchiveWriter</code>.
<p>
Now all of the components of the Product Tree have been built.  In the next step, they
will all be pieced together to form the entire product tree.
<p>
<hr><li><h3><a name="Step 10">Step 10: Build the product tree</a></h3>
      Add this code to the <code>createClientTree()</code> method:
<pre><strong>
binaries.addComponent(binFiles);
addComponent(binaries);

documentation.addComponent(docFiles);
addComponent(documentation);

ntDependency.addComponent(javaFiles);
NTjavademos.addComponent(ntDependency);
addComponent(NTjavademos);
</pre></strong>
These lines build the tree from the bottom-up. First we create the "Binaries"
subtree, then add that subtree to the product.  Next, we create the "Documentation"
subtree, and add that to the product.  Finally, we create the multi-level "NT Java Demos"
subtree, and add the subtree to the product.     
<p>
<hr><li><h3><a name="Step 11">Step 11: Create Configuration Panels</a></h3>
      Add this code to the <code>createClientTree()</code> method:
<pre><strong>
Object[] nameArgs = new Object[] {getProductName()};
DirectorySelectionPanel postConfigurePanel = new DirectorySelectionPanel(getWizardState(),
                    "Post Configuration Panel", "myDefaultDir", 
                    "myDefaultDir", "\\http");
postConfigurePanel.addDescriptionText(new Msg("com.sun.install.Install", 
                                      "PostConfigDirectoryDescription", 
                                      nameArgs));
postConfigurePanel.addLabelText(new Msg("com.sun.install.Install", 
                                      "PostConfigTextLabel"));
addNode(POSTINSTALL, postConfigurePanel);
</pre></strong>
This creates a single Directory Selection panel and places it as a
<em>post-install panel</em>.  Post-install panels are shown after
installation.  You can also place <em>pre-install panels</em> which
are shown directly before installation.  The arguments to the DirectorySelectionPanel
constructor are:
<p>
<ul>
<li><code>wizardState</code> - The <em>buildtime</em> wizard state, available from the superclass.
<li><code>"Post Configuration Panel"</code> - Default header name for this panel
<li><code>"myDefaultDir"</code> - The wizard state key under which is stored the default 
   directory displayed in the panel.
<li><code>"myDefaultDir"</code> (again) - The wizard state key under which this panel 
   should store the entry made by the user.  This is stored via the <code>isDisplayComplete()</code> 
   method of the panel.
<li><code>"\\http"</code> The default directory used during a panel reset, 
   normally this value is the same one stored under the default directory key.
</ul>
     
<p>
Note that the messages added using <code>addDescriptionText(..)</code> and <code>addLabelText(...)</code>
are localized. At runtime, the specified
locale resource bundle is searched according to the runtime locale. In
this case the resource bundle <code>com.sun.install.Install</code> will be
searched for a message corresponding to the supplied keys.
<p>
The DescriptionText is the text displayed to the user that describes
the data the panel is looking for.
<p>
The LabelText is the text displayed just above the text entry box
describing the contents of the entry box.
<p>
The addNode() argument is the type of panel this is
(either <code>POST_WELCOME</code>, <code>PRE_VERIFY</code>, 
<code>PREINSTALL</code> or <code>POSTINSTALL</code>) and the root of the panel tree
itself, or a single panel if desired.
<p>
You could create an entire subtree of panels and insert them as
post-install panels.  If you did this, the entire tree would be
visited after installation.  In those panels, you could do
post-install configuration of the newly-installed product according to
user input.  Or, you could do an electronic registration screen.
<p>
<hr><li><h3><a name="Step 12">Step 12: Finish the builder</a></h3>
add this method to the builder class, if it isn't already there:
<pre><strong>
public static void main(String[] args)
 {
   MyFirstBuilder sampleBuilder = new MyFirstBuilder();
   sampleBuilder.writeArchive();
   System.exit(0);
 }
</pre></strong>
This is the main method of your builder. This simply instantiates a builder
and writes it out to the current directory.
<p>
After this step, you should have a complete, runnable builder.
<hr><li><h3><a name="Step 13">Step 13: Compile & Run the builder & wizard</a></h3>
Once you have finished writing your builder you can go ahead and
compile and debug it. You can compile this builder by unsetting your <code>CLASSPATH</code>
and doing the following (on Windows, where your command prompt is <code>c:\sdk\classes&gt;</code>):
<pre>
c:\>set CLASSPATH=
c:\>cd [SDK Base Directory]\<strong>classes</strong>
c:\sdk\classes>javac WindowsBuilder.java
</pre>
If there were no errors, you can now run your builder to create your wizard archive:
<pre>
c:\sdk\classes>java WindowsBuilder
</pre>
If there are no errors, your builder should have produced a <code>wizard.class</code> file in the current directory.
This is your wizard!  You can then run your wizard by typing:
<pre>
c:\sdk\classes>java wizard
</pre>
You should see your wizard come up with the Welcome Panel.  If it does
not, look for error messages that might explain why.
<p>
</ul>
