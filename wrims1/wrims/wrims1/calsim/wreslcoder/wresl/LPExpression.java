/**
 *  Defines one row of an LP constraint.  Also, a portion of a row that is to be
 *  linearly combined with another one.
 *
 *  There is no mathematics and no numbers used here, only strings.
 *
 *  Two uses for this object:
 *  <p>
 *  (1) example where X and Y are decision variables and a,b, and c are constants:
 *        a*X + b*Y = c
 *  <p>
 *  (2) same example as (1) but you called keepLeft() after construction:
 *        a*X + b*Y + c
