      <blockquote>
	    A wizard is a graphical user interface model that is suited to task based software.  Task
	    based software is software that implements an algorithm with two or more steps that
	    must be done in sequential order.  Examples of task based software are software installation
	    and configuration.
	  <p>
	    A wizard consists of graphical panels that are designed to guide the user
	    through the task.  The user navigates through the set of panels with two buttons, back
	    and next.
	  <p>
	    The back button visits the previously displayed panel.  The next button visits
	    the following panel.  Through the use of these two buttons, the user is able to visit
	    each panel in the wizard and configure each of the panels.
	  <p>
	    The panels are used to configure the wizard to perform the task exactly as the user desires.
      </blockquote>
      <h3><a name="What can wizards be used for">2. What can wizards be used for?</h3>
    <a href="#Table Of Contents">Table of Contents</a>
      <blockquote>
	  Because the wizard guides the user through the steps required to perform a task, wizards
	  are a good user interface choice for software installation and configuration.
	  <p>
	    Software installation often requires many steps to be carried out in order for the
	    software product to work correctly and also to register the software in the product
	    registry so the product can be tracked, and later removed.  The instructions that describe
	    all of these steps would be difficult to write in such a way that they would work correctly
	    on all of the platforms that are supported by the product.  There is a strong possibility
	    that the user would get confused and install the software incorrectly.
	  <p>
	    Wizards aid in software installation, because they guide the user through steps to perform the installation.  The wizard presents panels that enable the user to configure
	    the installation (for example, specify the directory where the product should be installed).
	    Installation wizards increase the likelihood that the product will get
	    installed correctly and that the user will not get confused.  This reduces support calls related to software installation.  This also enables web deployment
	    of software.  The user
	    should be able to download one file (the install wizard) and install the software.  With
	    conventional README files, the user has to download multiple files and then use the documentation to 
follow the steps
	    manually.  The wizard facilitates ease of use for both the download and the installation.
	  <p>
	    Software configuration also benefits from the wizard model.  Because configuration is
	    often performed long after the software was installed, the documentation may have been misplaced
	    or be unavailable to the user at the time they want to configure or reconfigure
	    the software.
	  <p>
	    Because wizards guide the user through the configuration process, he can configure the software without necessarily having to 
use the documentation.

      <blockquote>
	  WebStart wizards are created using the WebStart Wizard Software Developer's Kit (SDK).  Java was
	  used to create the SDK in order to support multiple platforms with a common look and
	  feel.
	  <p>
	  <h5><a name="Wizard archive">Wizard Archive</h5>
	  <blockquote>
	      WebStart wizards are written into a self-extracting archive.  This makes the wizards easy to use
	      by not requiring the user to be a Java expert.
	      <p>
		If a JAR file were used for the wizard container, the user would have to set the
		classpath to include the JAR file, and specify on the command line which class within
		the JAR file to execute.  This generally requires that the user has read a README file, 
		or worse - that the user had to look at the JAR file's table of contents and try each
		class until one worked.
	      <p>
		The WebStart wizards are packaged in a single class file.  This class file has a
		class attribute that contains all of the supporting classes required by the wizard.
		This enables the wizard to run with the default classpath.  Upon execution, the wizard
		classes are read from the archive and made available (via a ClassLoader) to the
		wizard.  You can also include initialization data, images, audio, and other data
		in the wizard archive.
		</blockquote>
	  <h5><a name="Wizard GUI">Wizard GUI</h5>
	  <blockquote>
	      The WebStart wizard user interface is arranged in three sections:
	      <blockquote>
		<li>Identifying image</li>
		<li>Content panel</li>
		<li>Navigation panel</li>
	      </blockquote>
	      <p>
		Use the identifying image area to display an image that helps the user
		identify the purpose of the wizard.  This is a display-only area, and
		is not meant to query or collect information from the user.
	      <p>
				Use the content panels to display information to the user and also to collect
		information from the user that configures the wizard.  Only one content panel is displayed at a time.  The content panels are
		traversed through the use of the navigation panel.
	      <p>
		The navigation panel appears at the bottom of the wizard's graphical user interface.
		This panel contains buttons used to navigate through the wizard's content panels.
		A Back button is provided to allow the user to visit the previous panel.  A Next
		button is provided to allow the user to advance to the next panel.  The navigation
		panel also contains an Exit button, which is used to exit the wizard.
	  </blockquote>
	  <h5><a name="Cross platform wizards">Cross Platform Wizards</h5>
	  <blockquote>
	      The WebStart wizard SDK is platform independent.  
		For software installation, this means that the user can create a single install wizard that
		installs a Java application.  If that application includes native methods, the shared
		library for the platform the wizard is executed on is installed in a location
		that is searched when java.lang.System.loadLibrary() is called.  In this way, a
		simple HTML software deployment page could present customers with a single file to download,
		regardless of the target platform.  When executed, the wizard determines what platform
		it is installing on, and install the correct files in locations that make sense on the
		target platform.

	  <h5><a name="Wizard definitions">Wizard Definitions</h5>
	  <blockquote>
	      The following definitions will make the wizard process clearer:
	      <p>
		<b><a name="Wizard Archive">Wizard Archive:</b>  A wizard archive is a single class file that contains a
		graphical user interface that guides the user through a set of wizard panels.  This
		class archive is the wizard.
	      <p>
		<b><a name="Builder"><a href="api/com.sun.wizards.builder.ArchiveWriter.html">Builder:</a></b>  A
		wizard builder is a Java application that writes the wizard archive.  The builder
		is written using the WebStart SDK.  The builder is a subclass of 
		<a href="api/com.sun.wizards.builder.ArchiveWriter.html">ArchiveWriter</a>. It defines
		which wizard panels are displayed, and also what tasks the wizard performs.
	      <p>
		<b><a href="api/Package-com.sun.wizards.panels.html">Panel:</a></b>  A wizard panel
		displays in the content panel area of the wizard.  Wizard
		panels present information to the user and collect the user's
		preferences.  Panels enable the user to configure
		the wizard.  Wizard panels are subclassed from
		<a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardLeaf.html">WizardLeaf</a>.
	      <p>
		<b><a name="Client Tree">Client Tree</b>  A wizard client tree is a tree structure
		consisting of wizard panels and wizard nodes.  The tree structure defines what
		panels the wizard can display and the order in which those panels are displayed.
		It also allows for multiple paths.  The tree structure allows groups of panels
		to optionally be skipped during navigation.  This enables you to create a
		wizard with a simple set of panels for a beginner to configure. It
		also provides more complex panels for the advanced users to exert more control
		over the wizard's configuration.
	      <p>
		<b><a href="api/Package-com.sun.wizards.nodes.html">Node:</a></b>  A node is an
		object within the client tree that groups panels together.  A node can choose to
		have its panels skipped.  You can use nodes to create a wizard hierarchy.
	      <p>
		<b><a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardTreeManager.html">Client</a></b>  Client
		refers to the classes that comprise the part of the wizard that executes
		on the client side.  You can configure a wizard so that the tasks are	performed
		on one machine (the remote machine) and the user interface is displayed on another
		machine (the local machine).  All classes that are executed on the local machine are
		considered the client.  These classes include:
	      <blockquote>
		<li><a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardTreeManager.html">WizardTreeManager</a></li>

	      </blockquote>
	      <p>
		<b><a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardState.html">Server</a></b>  Server refers
		to all of the classes that comprise the part of the wizard that executes on the
		server side.  A wizard can be configured such thhat the tasks are performed on one
		machine (the remote machine) and the user interface is displayed on another machine
		(the local machine).  All classes that are executed on the remote machine are
		considered the server.  These classes include:
		<blockquote>
		<li><a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardState.html">WizardState</a></li>

		</blockquote>
	      <p>
		<b><a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.Task.html">Task</a></b>  A task is an object
		that performs an operation on the server.  Tasks are added to a 
		<a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.Sequence.html">Sequence</a> object.  A task is
		a single element of execution.
	      <p>
		<a name="Sequence">
		  <b><a href="api/com.sun.wizards.core.Sequence.html">Sequence</a></b>  A Sequence is

	  <h5><a name="Wizard creation overview">Wizard Creation Overview</h5>
	  <blockquote>
	    The creation of a wizard involves 2 steps:
	      <ol>
		<li>Write the wizard <a href="#Builder">builder</a>.</li>
		<li>Run the wizard builder to create the wizard archive.</li>
	      </ol>

	      The wizard builder is responsible for creating the 
	      <a href="#Wizard Archive">wizard archive</a>.
	      In practice, the wizard builder will create and initialize objects
	      and then serialize those objects into a class attribute appended
	      to a class file.  This resulting class file (having the serialized
	      classes and initialization data embeded in it) is the
	      wizard archive.
	      <p>
	      There are four key elements the wizard builder must set up in order
	      to create a functional wizard archive:

	      <ol>
	      <li>The <a href="#Client Tree">client tree</a> structure and contents.</li>
