      <h1>The Client</h1>
      The wizard client classes present a user with a graphical user interface
      used to manipulate the settings on the server.  As stated in <a href="Section2.html">Wizard Architecture</a> and
      <a href="Section3.html">The Server</a>, the server is responsible for performing the task that defines
      the purpose of the wizard.  Without the client classes, the server would be
      able to perform its operation, but the user would have no way of modifying
      the settings within the WizardState.
      <p>
	The main responsibility of the client classes is to provide an interface
	through which the user can guide the execution of the wizard.  Other
	important features the client should have include: </P> 
<UL>
<LI>The ability to run within a browser 
<LI>A common interface for navigation 
<LI>A user interface specific to the wizard being executed
</UL>
      <p>
	The client responsibilities are fulfilled by a set of classes connected by
	a WizardTreeManager object, which implements the Mediator design pattern.
	This design pattern was also used on the server (*html tag here).  Each
	object in the client maintains a reference (or is able to request a
	reference) to the WizardTreeManager.
	<p>
	The ability to run in a browser influences the
	implementation of the entire client.  The WizardConsole is the class
	responsible for the layout of the wizard.  The WizardConsole is subclassed
	from Panel, and can be used either within a frame (for application mode) or
	within an Applet (for browser mode).  The WizardConsole provides the
	interface between the system environment and the other client classes.
	Other responsibilities of the WizardConsole include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Listening for window events
<LI>Setting the title of the wizard frame
<LI>Exiting the application (or disconnecting from the server if the client is in a browser) 
<LI>Displaying dialog boxes 
<LI>Instantiating the WizardTreeManager
</UL>
	<p>
	The WizardTreeManager is responsible for creating all of the panels that
	are displayed by the WizardConsole.  The panels consist of the image panel,
	the navigation panel, and the wizard panel.  The image panel 
	displays an image that can be used for quick identification of the purpose
	of the wizard.  The navigation panel presents a common interface for wizard
	user interface traversal.  The wizard panel provides a space for panels to
	be displayed that will guide the user through the wizard setup and execution.
	<p>
	The WizardTreeManager is also responsible for deserializing the wizard-specific
	panels (referred to as the client panel tree) from the wizard archive.  To
	do this, the WizardTreeManager uses the WizardState object
	to read the client section from the archive.  The WizardTreeManager instantiates
	each of the client tree panels, and gives each panel the opportunity to
	deserialize its required initialization data from the archive.
	<p>
	The WizardTreeManager facilitates the retrieval of all data stored in the
	wizard archive.  Common examples of data that the client will access are
	image data, initialization data, and audio data.  Client objects will use
	the getNamedResource method to retrieve data from the archive.
	<p>
	The WizardTreeManager manages the client panel tree traversal.  This
	is accomplished by listening for events originating from the navigation
	buttons and sending messages to the IteratorLayout object that is responsible
	for traversing the tree.  By making the navigation mechanism a part of the
	client-side architecture, all wizards will have the same navigation semantics
	and behavior.  This user experience reuse reduces confusion and helps
	instill user confidence during the wizard execution.
	<p>
	The wizard client tree panels are arranged in a tree structure.  The tree is
	comprised of leafs (the panels to be displayed), and nodes (objects that have
	panels and/or nodes as children).  The structure of the tree, combined with the
	logic in the panels and nodes, determines the order in which the panels are
	displayed.  Nodes can be used to enable or disable the traversal of its child
	panels, which provides alternate paths that the user can explore to make
	additional decisions about how the wizard will execute.  This facilitates
	creating a single wizard with good default values that require no user
	intervention. This can also be used to allow the user to enter advanced
	settings.  This feature can be used to broaden the audience of a particular
	wizard to include novice as well as advanced users.
	<p>
	The wizard panels that comprise the client panel tree are subclassed from
	WizardLeaf.  The nodes in the client panel tree are subclassed from
	WizardComposite.  Both WizardLeaf and WizardComposite are subclassed from
	WizardComponent. Together these objects implement the Composite design
	pattern.  The Composite design pattern facilitates creating complex
	structures like the client panel tree.  Though the tree is composed of nodes
	and leafs, the Composite design pattern allows all objects comprising the tree
	to be treated identically.  This allows the IteratorLayout object to use the
	same interface on both leafs and nodes.
	<p>
	The wizard panel tree is created within the builder by specifying the
	children of the root node.  Each panel is instantiated and added to the
	node through a call to addChild.  Nodes can be added in the same way.  When
	the builder writes the wizard archive, the client panel tree is serialized.
	Each panel has the responsibility of recording all the information
	necessary for proper initialization into the archive.  This is done by
	overriding the serialize method of WizardComponent.  As each panel in the
	tree is recorded into the archive, the serialize method of that panel is
	called.
	<p>
	When the wizard is executed, the WizardTreeManager deserializes the client
	panel tree.  As each object in the tree is instantiated, that object has a
	responsibility to read its initialization data from the archive.  This is
	done through a call to the deserialize method of WizardComponent.  The
	deserialize method must read its information in exactly the same order as
	it was written in the serialize method.  Any discrepancy in the
	correspondence of serialize and deserialize results in creating
	a wizard that will not initialize correctly.  This problem is reported on
	the console, and is easy to find and correct.
	<p>
	Each panel and node within the client panel tree can choose not to be shown.
	This provides different paths through the panels.
	The skip method of WizardComponent is used to indicate whether the panel or
	node should be displayed.  The skip method in WizardComponent always returns
	true, indicating that the panel or node should be displayed.  Subclasses of
	WizardComponent often will look at data within the WizardState to determine
	if the panel should be displayed or not.  If a node returns false from the
	skip method, none of the children of that node are
	displayed.
