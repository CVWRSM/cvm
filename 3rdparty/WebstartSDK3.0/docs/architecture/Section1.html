      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      A wizard is a self-contained program that uses a graphical user interface
      to guide the user through the successful completion of a task.  Generally
      the task requires a fair level of knowledge if the user were to perform the
      task manually.  The wizard guides the user through the steps of performing
      the tasks in the correct order, and provides visual cues for the information
      required.  Through providing software that performs a complicated or fault
      intolerant action, software vendors can approach the goal of delivering
      software that does not require the user to refer to a manual at every step.
      <p>
      Examples of tasks that would benefit from a wizard are software installation,
      software setup, and product configuraton.  These are all tasks that the user
      does not perform very often, and generally require detailed knowledge of the
      particular product being installed or configured.        The wizard provides task-specific feedback to users at the most important
      time: when they are actually trying to perform the task.
      <p>
      The wizard architecture follows a strict client-server model to enable wizards to be run remotely.
      The user interface of the wizard can be displayed on a different machine than
      the one being affected by the wizard.  For example, an install wizard could
      be used to install software on one machine (xray), by using the wizard user
      interface running on a different machine (xenophobe).
      <p>
      The most predominant solution for providing this remote effect on Unix is to
      write the application with the X window system API.  The remote feature of
      wizards should be more universal than the Unix approach.  The user interface
      for a wizard should be platform independent.  It should make no difference
      whether it is displayed on Windows 95 or Solaris.  The server side of the
      wizard (the set of classes that complete the desired task) may be more platform
      specific.
      <p>
      To facilitate a platform-independent solution, the wizard architecture is
      implemented in Java.  This enables the client side classes to be displayed in a
      browser.  The client and server parts of the wizard are connected together
      either directly, when the wizard runs as an application, or
      through Remote Method Invocation (RMI) when the wizard client runs
      in a web browser.  Some operating systems do not install TCP/IP unless a network
      card is installed in the system.  Because RMI requires TCP/IP to be installed on
      the system, RMI must be an optional addition to facilitate remote use.  
      <p>
      Wizards are packaged in a wizard archive.  This archive is essentially a java
      class file that contains every resource required to execute the wizard.  The
      required resources include:  supporting Java class files, image files,
      initialization data, the sequence of wizard panels, and other information
      required by the specific wizard application.  To execute the wizard, the user
      simply runs the Java Virtual Machine on the wizard archive.  The supporting class files and
      images are extracted from the archive as the wizard initializes.
      <p>
      Generating a wizard involves creating the user experience  (the
      panels the user experiences when running the wizard and the order of those
      panels), creating the set of tasks required to perform the desired action, and
      creating a builder that will write the wizard archive.
