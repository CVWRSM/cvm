    <h3><a name="intro">1. Introduction: Hierarchical Wizards</a></h3>
      <p>
	This tutorial covers the basic notion of a hierarchical
	wizard, and how to use these concepts to implement a set of
	hierarchical wizards.  It is assumed that you have a basic
	understanding of Web Start Wizards, and their purpose.
      It is also assumed that you have read and understood the <a href="../../../docs/architecture/Section6.html">Hierarchical
      specification</a> from the <a href="../../../docs/SDK_Userguide.html">SDK Userguide</a>.
      <p>
      <ul>
	<li><h4><a name="whatis">What is a wizard hierarchy?</h4>
    </ul>
      <blockquote>
	<p>
	  The Web Start Wizard API can be used to create singular
	  wizards that are designed to do a specific task, such as
	  doing disk defragmentation.  The user steps through a
	  sequence of screens and performs the task, then exits.  This
	  is the standard usage for the wizard model.
	<p>
	  Another possibility is that someone wants to perform many
	  tasks, each of which has an associated wizard already
	  designed to perform the task.  In this case, rather than
	  having the user run each separate wizard, they can be
	  combined, or <em>aggregated</em> to form a single wizard,
	  with each wizard part of a <em>hierarchy</em>, with one
	  wizard at the top of the hierarchy in a tree-like fasion.
	  This is what is known as <em><strong>hierarchical
	  wizards</strong></em>, where all wizards work together to
	  perform many tasks, while providing a <em> single user
	  interface experience.</em>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
	<li><h4><a name="whyuse">Why use hierarchical wizards?</h4>
    </ul>
      <blockquote>
	<p>
	  A wizard hierarchy allows multiple wizards to work
	  together. For example, one application of wizards is
	  software installation. Generally, an install wizard would be
	  designed to install a single product. It would be nice if
	  multiple products could be installed from the same wizard. A
	  CD-ROM with four products on it could be installed from a
	  single wizard in the root directory of the CD-ROM that
	  connects four single product install wizards into one user
	  experience. The wizard hierarchy preserves the user's
	  ability to use the single product install wizards, as well
	  as provide a multi-product installation solution described
	  above.
      </blockquote>
    <h3><a name="basics">2. The Basics</a></h3>
    <p>

      Every wizard has a sequence of components, some of which are
      actual graphical panels, others of which are groups, or
      <em>containers</em> of panels, called <a
      href="../../../docs/api/Package-com.sun.wizards.nodes.html">Nodes</a> that it
      steps through to provide the user experience.  A set of
      components can grouped by adding them all to a <a
      href="../../../docs/api/Package-com.sun.wizards.nodes.html">Node</a>, which is
      a container for components.  This subtree of components will
      then be visted in left-to-right order.  In an upper-level
      wizard, custom nodes can be created and placed into the tree
      that do more than just group components together.  One special
      type that we have provided in the Web Start Wizards SDK is the
      <a
      href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.nodes.HierarchyNode.html">HierarchyNode</a>.

    <ul>
      <li><h4><a name="hierarchynode">The <a href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.nodes.HierarchyNode.html">HierarchyNode class</a></h4>
    </ul>
      <blockquote>
      <p> 

	The HierarchyNode is a special type of grouper (container).
	The HierarchyNode does dynamic, or run-time, grouping of
	components.  It collects it's components at runtime from
	<em>other wizards</em> that exist in the same VM.  When the
	user clicks <strong>next</strong> and advances onto one of
	these HierarchyNodes, the node goes off and retrieves the
	components that it should contain at that time, then
	automatically adds the group of components to itself, causing
	the user to proceed automatically onto the sequence of
	components that the HierarchyNode gathered.

      <p>

	These HierarchyNodes are used in a top-level wizard, or
	"connector" wizard as they are sometimes called, to group
	similar sets of components from lower-level wizards, and to
	display all of the similar groups of components at the same
	time.  They will, at runtime, collect groups of components
	from other wizards and add them into a single set of panels,
	grouped by a HierarchyNode.

      <p>

	<li><h4><a name="know">How does a HierarchyNode know
	which components to aggregate?</a></h4>

      <p>
      First and foremost, HierarchyNodes only exist in connector wizards.
      The lowest-level wizards have no knowledge of what might be
      in the upper-level wizards.
      <p>

	In a lower-level wizard, the only components that are
	candidates for later aggregation into an upper-level wizard
	are those components that exist directly <em>below</em> the
	<em>root</em> node in the client panel tree.  When building
	the lower-level wizards, care must be taken to give a name to
	the <a href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardComponent.html">WizardComponents</a>
	that might be later aggregated into a HierarchyNode in a
	top-level wizard (using the <code>setName()</code> and <code>getName()</code> API,
	or the API that might exist in the constructor).
	<p>
	Then, when building an upper-level, or <em>connector</em> wizard, care must
	be taken to name the HierarchyNode with the <em>same exact</em> name as the
	components that this HierarchyNode is supposed to aggregate.  This is how the
	HierarchyNode knows which components to gather.
	
	These topics are discussed below.
	</ul>
    <h3><a name="stepbystep">3. Step-by-Step Install Wizards Example</a></h3>
      Suppose you have many products, each of which you want to be
      able to install separately.  You can create separate wizards for
      each of your products and ship them separately.  You can also
      create a top-level wizard, and combine all of your product-level
      wizards into a hierarchy, and have them all install in a single
      user experience.  This is the goal of the hierarchical wizards
      paradigm.
      <p>

	An example of this is Sun Microsystems' <a
	href="http://www.sun.com/solaris/easyaccess/">Solaris Easy
	Access Server</a> product.  This product contains several
	other products, each of which might be installed
	separately. In addition, you can install the entire product by
	using a single wizard, which pulls pieces of each lower-level,
	or product-level, wizard, into a single wizard.  The pieces
	pulled are the pieces that are responsible for customizing the
	install, such as install location, which components to
	install, etc.

      <ul>
	<li><h4><a name="createlower">Creating the lower-level install wizards</a></h4>
	<p>
	Creating the lower-level install wizards entails using the <a
	href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.InstallArchiveWriter.html"><code>InstallArchiveWriter</code></a>
	superclass to create your wizard.  This class has pre-defined containers
	into which you can put custom components (such as panels).  The pre-defined places
	are:
<p>
	<ul>

	<li><code>POST_WELCOME</code>: Components placed into this
	container appear immediately after the user presses
	<strong>next</strong> on the <a
	href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.panels.WelcomePanel.html">WelcomePanel</a>.

	<li><code>PRE_VERIFY</code>: Components placed into this
	container appear immediately before the user sees the <ba
	href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.panels.VerifyPanel.html">VerifyPanel</a>,
	which is shown just before Installation.
	    
	<li><code>PREINSTALL</code>: Components placed into this
	container appear immediately after the user presses
	<strong>next</strong> on the <a
	href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.panels.VerifyPanel.html">VerifyPanel</a>.
	This is a good place to put pre-install components that might
	pre-configure the product to install, or to ask a last-minute
	question of the user.

	<li><code>POSTINSTALL</code>: Components placed into this
	container appear immediately after the product is done
	installing.  This is a good place for post-install
	configuration screens which might require the user to answer
	some questions before continuing.
      </ul>
      <p>
	These containers are represented in any upper-level wizards as well, by using a HierarchyNode to
	visit each container from each subwizard, in the order the wizards were added with <code>addWizard()</code>.
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li><h4><a name="examplelower">An example of a product-level installer</a></h4>
      <p>

	Here is an example of a wizard builder that will build wizards
	that will later be used in a top-level wizard.  You can cut
	and paste this code into your favorite editor, compile it, and
	run it.  
	<p>
	This source code can also be found <a href="../src/LowerLevelHierarchyBuilder.java">here</a>.
	<p>
	It will create a wizardthat installs a sample product:

      To compile and run this wizard, save the file as <code>LowerLevelHierarchyBuilder.java</code>
      and issue the following commands, making sure the Wizard SDK classes are in your <code>CLASSPATH</code>:
      (note that the "$" is a shell prompt, and should not be typed)
      
      <pre>
$ javac LowerLevelHierarchyBuilder.java
$ java LowerLevelHierarchyBuilder MyProduct1 MyProductComponent1 /home/jhf/tmp/files
$ java LowerLevelHierarchyBuilder MyProduct2 MyProductComponent2 /home/jhf/tmp/files
      </pre>
      You should substitute your own names and paths to some sample files
      that exist on your system. This will create two files in the
      same directory called <code>MyProduct1.class</code> and
      <code>MyProduct2.class</code> that you can then run by
      typing:

      <pre>
$ java MyProduct1
</pre>
or
<pre>
$ java MyProduct2
      </pre>
      This will cause the wizard(s) to run, and you can install the files if you so desire.
      <p>
	The next section shows you how to include the wizards you created into a <em>hierarchical</em>
	set of wizards.
	<p>
      </ul>
	<li><h4><a name="createupper">Creating the upper-level "connector" wizard</a></h4>
      To create an upper-level wizard, you simply declare that the
      <code>InstallArchiveWriter</code> superclass make an
      upper-level, or connector wizard rather than a lower-level
      wizard.  You do this by using the <a
      href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.InstallArchiveWriter.html#setConnector(boolean)"><code>setConnector()</code></a>
      API of <code>InstallArchiveWriter</code>.  In addition, you must
      declare which wizards the connector wizard will look for and
      read from at install-time.  You do this by using the <a
      href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.InstallArchiveWriter.html#addWizard(java.lang.String,
      int)"><code>addWizard()</code></a> API of
      <code>InstallArchiveWriter</code>.
      <p>
	<ul>
	<li><h4><a name="exampleupper">An example of an upper-level "connector" installer</a></h4>
	An example wizard builder is shown below, which takes the

	upper-level wizard that uses these lower-level wizards at
	runtime.

	<li><h4><a name="runupper">Creating the upper-level "connector" wizard</a></h4>
To compile and use this class, run the following commands (assuming you named your previous archives <code>MyProduct1.class</code> and
<code>MyProduct2.class</code>):
<pre>
% javac UpperLevelHierarchyBuilder.java
% java UpperLevelHierarchyBuilder MyProduct1.class MyProduct2.class
</pre>
This will create a connector wizard called <code>connector.class</code>.  You can run this wizard by typing:
<pre>
% java connector
</pre>
This will cause the wizard to run, and you can install each of the
subwizard's products by stepping through the customization for each
product, by selecting <strong>"Custom Install"</strong> on the <a
href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.panels.ProductPanel.html"><code>ProductPanel</code></a>.
</ul>
</ul>
    <h3><a name="conclusion">4. Conclusion</a></h3>
This tutorial has shown how to use the Install API to create wizards that can later be aggregated by upper-level wizards, using the HierarchyNode concept.  Generic non-install Wizards can also be created, and, using a HierarchyNode, components can be referenced from upper-level wizards and be stepped through.  
<p>
The wizard hierarchy is not limited to one or two levels.  Any number
of upper-level wizards can be created.  In this example, we have shown 
a product level install wizard and an upper level install wizard put
together in a wizard hierarchy.  A level above that upper level could be
created to allow one installer to install products from multiple connector
installers.

This concludes this Hierarchy Tutorial.  For more information on creating wizards for Solaris, please visit our website
