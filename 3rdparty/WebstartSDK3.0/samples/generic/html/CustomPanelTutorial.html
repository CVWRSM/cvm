    <h3><a name="intro">1. Introduction: Custom Install Wizards</a></h3>
    <p>
        This tutorial covers the basic ideas behind custom install
    wizards, and how to write custom panels that interact with custom
    <a
    href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.ServerObject.html">
    ServerObjects</a> and custom <a
    href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.Task.html">Tasks</a>
    to accomplish things.  It is assumed that you have a basic
    understanding of Web Start Wizards, and their purpose.
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><h4><a name="whatis">What is a <em>Custom Install Wizard</em>?</h4>

    
    <p>A custom install wizard is basic install wizard, with custom panels and/or
      tasks that have been added to perform installation of a product that requires customization.
    <p>
      The Web Start Install Wizard API can be used to create self-contained
      wizards that install a product, or a suite of products.  The basic install
      wizard has a few common things, such as directory selection, install
      progress, and a summary of what installed.  Beyond that, each wizard can be
      customized to do a custom installation, accomplishing tasks specific to that
      product.  This tutorial covers creating install wizards which are customized
      for a particular product.  If your product is simple, you can simply use the
      provided sequence of panels and actions, without any customization.  You would
      extends the <a href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.InstallArchiveWriter.html">InstallArchiveWriter</a> API.
      If your product contains customizable installation options, read on!
    <p>
      

      <li><h4><a name="whyuse">Why use custom install wizards?</h4>

    
    <p>
      A custom install wizard can perform custom installations that a
      standard install wizard would otherwise not do.  For example,
      suppose your product is a web server.  After installation, you
      would like to ask the user which port the newly-installed server
      should listen on.  Then, you want to save this information in a
      file so that the newly-installed product can use the information
      when the user runs it for the first time.  In this case, you
      would create one Panel that prompts the user, and an associated
      ServerObject that would write the file (these concepts are
      explained below).
      </ul>
    <h3><a name="basics">2. The Basics</a></h3>
    <p>
      In order to create a custom panel, your panel must inherit from
      <a
      href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardLeaf.html">
      WizardLeaf</a>, the common superclass for all wizard panels.
      Your panel must also override certain methods to draw its GUI,
      and interact with the rest of the system (much as a
      java.awt.Panel might override <code>paint()</code> to draw
      itself).
    <p>
      The "interaction" metioned above involves your panel
      interacting with ServerObjects and Tasks to perform their
      tasks.  For example, if your custom panel reads in a file and
      presents it to the user, you would write a ServerObject to
      read in the file, and have your panel communicate with the
      ServerObject to read the file and present it to the user.  Why
      is this necessary?  Why not just read the file using java code
      written in the panel?  The answer is that wizards were
      designed to be <em>client/server</em>.  The user interaction
      takes place on the client, and then the client subsequently
      interacts with the server to actually perform tasks.  The
      client and server are completely separate entities, even if
      they are executing on the same computer.
      
    <p>
      Currently, when a Web Start Wizard is executed, the client and
      server exist on the same computer that the wizard is run on.
      However, in the future, wizards might be
      <em>"remote-enabled"</em>, meaning the client and server might
      not exist on the same computer.  Rather, they will exist
      separately and communicate via the underlying network.  It is
      strongly recommended that you keep your client code (i.e. the
      code in your panel class) separate from the server code
      (i.e. The code that interacts with the underlying system), so
      that in the future your wizard will run remotely, with no
      additional work.
    <p>
      
    <ul>
      <li><h4><a name="wizardleaf">The <a href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardLeaf.html">WizardLeaf class</a></h4>
    
    
    <p> The WizardLeaf class is the superclass of all custom panels
    that you may create.  In other words, if you are creating a custom
    panel, make <em>sure</em> that your class extends WizardLeaf.
    <p>
      This class provides the interface for your panel to interact
      with the rest of the wizard.  Your panel can then call the
      methods it inherits to accomplish certain things, such as
      querying the user, or performing a <a
	href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.Sequence.html">Sequence</a>.
      Your panel can also override certain methods that will cause the
      wizard to behave differently.  You should be familiar with the
      APIs of the WizardLeaf, as well as the <a
	href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardTreeManager.html">WizardTreeManager</a>
      API, and the <a
	href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardState.html">WizardState</a>,
      since these are the main APIs that your custom panel can use.
    <p> 
      A basic panel can do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Override the <code>createUI()</code> method.  This method is
	called when a panel is encountered in the sequence of all
	panels.  <em>This method is only called once, the first time the
	  panel is visted</em>.  Therefore, in this method, you should
	create and initialize any GUI objects (such as TextAreas or
	Buttons), and place them onto the panel (via the
	<code>add()</code> method of <code>java.awt.Panel</code>, which
	your panel inherits from).
        <p>
      <li>Override the <code>beginDisplay()</code> method.  This
	method is called <em>each time</em> your panel is visited.  This
	method should be used to refresh the GUI components, if needed.
	It should <em>not</em> be used to create and add GUI components
	to the panel, since the user may visit the panel many times.
	For example, if you had these lines in your
	<code>beginDisplay()</code> method:
        <pre>
Button b = new Button("Press Me"); add(b);
        </pre>
        Then, every time the user visited the panel, a new button
        would be added to the panel!  If the user clicks "Back" and
        "Next" several times, many, many buttons would appear, which
        is probably not what you had intended.  Put this code in the
        <code>createUI()</code> method.
        <p>
      <li>Override the <code>isDisplayComplete()</code> method.  This
	method is called when the user clicks the "Next" button to
	advance to the next panel after yours.  In this method, you can
	validate any data the user entered, to make sure the data is
	valid.  If the user entered good data, your method can
	<code>return true</code>, indicating it is safe to move on.  If
	the user did not enter good data (e.g. They entered a number
	instead of their name), then your method should detect this and
	<code>return false</code>, indicating the wizard should not
	advance to the next panel. You also might want to inform the
	user of what they did wrong.  One way to do this is to use the
	<code>displayQuery()</code> API of <a
	  href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardTreeManager.html">WizardTreeManager</a>.
	Each panel has a reference to the Wizard Tree Manager (there is
	only one manager, and it manages <em>all</em> panels.)  To
	reference the manager, use the <code>getTreeManager()</code>
	method call from your panel. The example below includes this
	idea.
        <p>
      <li>Override the <code>addRuntimeResources()</code> method.
      This method is used to declare any classes that your custom
	panel will need at runtime.  Since the final wizard you create
	is fully self-contained, any classes that you wrote that are
	needed by the custom panel must be declared in this method so
	that it gets included into the wizard, available at runtime.
	Otherwise a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> will result, and
	your wizard will not function correctly.
        <p>
    </ul>
    Make sure the compiled classes are available via the <code>CLASSPATH</code> when building your wizard.
    <p>
      
      <li><h4><a name="task">The <a href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.Task.html">Task</a> class</h4>
    The task class is the superclass of all Task objects.  A Task
    object exists on the <em>server-side</em> and, as such, can access
    system resources of the underlying system.
    <p>
      Tasks are grouped into <a
      href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.Sequence.html">Sequences</a>,
      which allow multiple tasks to execute in a particular order, and
      to combine each task's progress into an overall progress that
      can be reported back to the panel that executed the Sequence.
    <p>
      The two main methods of the Task class that your custom task should override
      are:
    <ul>
      <li><code>perform()</code>.  The <code>perform()</code> method
        is called when the sequence that contains it is performed.  In
        this method, your tasks should perform its primary function.
        Tasks are performed in the same order as they were added to
        the sequence.
	<p>
      <li><code>reverse()</code>.  The <code>reverse()</code> method
	is called when the sequence that contains it is reversed.  In
	this method, your tasks should reverse its primary function.
	Note that this method is not required.  Tasks are reversed in
	the same order as they were added to the sequence.
	<p>
    </ul>
    During the execution of your task's <code>perform()</code> method,
    you can also call <code>setProgress</code> to update the
    sequence's idea of the overall progress of the sequence.  You
    should pass an <code>int</code> between 0 and 100 to indicate the
    percentage of the task's progress is complete.
    <p>
      There are other uses of the Task class that can be used.  Consult the API documentation
      for more advanced ideas.
    <p>
      
      <li><h4><a name="serverobject">The <a href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.ServerObject.html">ServerObject</a> class</h4>
    
    A ServerObject has many similarities to a Task.  It exists on the
    server side, and as such, can access the resources of the
    underlying system.  It can also be called from a panel, and
    interact with the panel.  But that is the extent of the
    similarities.  There is no analogy of a Sequence that contains
    ServerObjects.  Also, there is no automatic progress reporting and
    aggregation that the Task/Sequence classes provide. However, the
    ServerObject does not limit you to executing code from the
    <code>perform()</code> and <code>reverse()</code>.  Your server
    object can provide <em>any</em> API that you wish, and your panels
    can call on that API, and return results.  There are no methods to
    override, it simply exists and can be called upon by panels
    similar to the way sequences are called upon.
    <p>
      The ServerObject is useful for performing small, relatively fast
      tasks that do not need the underlying progress architecture
      inherent with Tasks.
    <p>
      
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="putting">3. Putting it all together</a></h3>

    The <em>builder</em> is a class that you run in order to
    <em>build</em> a wizard archive. See <a
    href="../../../docs/architecture/Section9.html">The Wizard Archive
    Builder</a> for more information on builders.  In your builder,
    you instantiate and configure the pieces that make up the wizard,
    and then write them out to a wizard archive.  The resulting
    archive is then runnable and represents your wizard.
    <p>
    In order for your custom Panels, Tasks, and ServerObjects to be
    available at runtime, you must write your builder to include them.
    In addition, your panel class definition must declare certain
    constructors in order to work with the underlying wizard
    architecture.
    <ul>
      <li> <em>Creating and using Panels.</em> The <a
      href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.InstallArchiveWriter.html">InstallArchiveWriter</a>
      API provides a basic install builder that makes a basic panel
      sequence for you.  Your builder can extend from it and use its API to configure
	your install wizard.  The panel sequence it creates is somewhat
      configurable but cannot do extreme customization.  If you want
      to modify your install builder beyond what the
      InstallArchiveWriter builder provides, you will have to create a
      custom panel sequence from scratch, including every panel that
      might be shown during the wizard's execution.  
	<p>
	  The example below creates a complete install wizard panel
	  sequence as well as a <a
	  href="../../../docs/architecture/install/Section2.html#Product Tree">Product
	  Tree</a>, which is a way to represent your product to be
	  installed.  This is the same sequence of panels that might
	  be generated if one were to use the <a
	  href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.InstallArchiveWriter.html">InstallArchiveWriter</a>
	  API, except the source code is provided for you to modify at will.
	  <p>
	  Notice the lines pertaining to the instantiation of the
	  wizard panel sequence (located in the
	  <code>buildPanelTree()</code> method).  In this example builder,
	  We are building a
	  tree structure that represents the panel sequence.  The
	  panels are then visited in a depth-first order
	  (i.e. left-to-right, children first).  
	  <p>
	  Each panel is
	  instantiated and then added to its parent.  The first node
	  instantiated is added as the <em>root</em> node, which is
	  visited first.  Each node is either a <a
	  href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardComposite.html">WizardComposite</a>
	  or a <a
	  href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardComponent.html">WizardComponent</a>.
	  The difference is that WizardComposites can have children,
	  whereas WizardComponents cannot.  In addition, some nodes
	  can dynamically modify the sequence of panels displayed.
	  For example, the <a
	  href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.nodes.SkipNode.html">SkipNode</a>
	  can cause its child nodes and panels to be skipped if some
	  condition is met.  When the SkipNode is visited, its
	  condition is evaluated, and the <code>skip()</code> method
	  returns <code>true</code> to indicate that this node, and
	  all of its children, should be skipped.
	  <p>
	  You will instantiate your custom panels and nodes, and build
	  a tree in the same manner as the example below.  Feel free
	  to copy this builder and modify it for your own uses. <a
	  href="../src/CustomBuilder.java"> Here
	  is the source code</a>.
	  <p>
        <li><h4><a name="taskintr">Creating and using Tasks and Sequences from your Panel</a></h4>
  To create and use Tasks and Sequences, you create the sequence, add
  tasks to the sequence, then add the sequence to the wizard.  For example, you might write
  the following code in your builder:
<pre>
CustomTask myTask = new CustomTask();
Sequence mySequence = new Sequence();
mySequence.addTask(myTask);
getWizardState().addSequence("MyCustomSequence", mySequence);
</pre>
        You can then perform your sequence from a panel by using:
<pre>
WizardTreeManager manager = getTreeManager();
manager.callServerObjectMethod(
       getRoute(),
       "performSequence",
       new String[] {"com.sun.wizards.core.Route.class",
	             "java.lang.String.class",
	             "java.lang.Boolean.TYPE",
	             "java.lang.String.class"},
       new Object[] {getRoute(null), 
                     "MyCustomSequence",
	             new Boolean(false), 
                     "sequenceComplete"});
</pre>
    <font size=-2><blockquote>See the <a href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.WizardTreeManager.html#callServerObjectMethod(com.sun.wizards.core.Route, java.lang.String, java.lang.String[], java.lang.Object[])">WizardTreeManager.callServerObjectMethod()</a> API for more information on how to make this method call.
</blockquote></font>
        Your sequence will then be executed, and either wait for
        completion, or return immediately, depending on the API you
        used to make the method call.  In this example, the method
        call will not wait for completion of the sequence.  When the
        sequence is complete, the <code>void sequenceComplete()</code>
        method will be called.
        <p> 
      If the panel that calls your sequence has a method with the following signature:
<pre>
public void setProgress(int[] progress)
{
[...]
}
</pre>
    Then, when one of the tasks in your sequence calls
    <code>setProgress()</code>, the sequence is "bubbled up" and weighted
    with all the tasks in the progress, and reported back to
    your panel through this <code>setProgress</code> method in your
    panel.  The number reported is a percentage of the entire sequence, from
    0 to 100, inclusive.
    If the sequence has only one task, then the progress reported is for that
    sole task.
    <p>

        <li><h4><a name="serverobjectintr">Creating and using ServerObjects from your Panel</a></h4>
  ServerObjects are used in a similar way.  To create a server object,
  your class should extend the ServerObject class in the Web Start
  Wizards API, and implement any functionality it needs to.  Then, to
  create and store your server object into the wizard from your
  builder, you would:
<pre>
CustomServerObject obj = new CustomServerObj();
getWizardState().addChildObject("MyObject", obj);
</pre>
  Then, to call upon your custom server object's <code>Integer
  doThis(Integer start)</code> method from a panel, you would:
<pre>
WizardTreeManager manager = getTreeManager();
Route serverObjectRoute = getRoute().getChildServerRoute("MyObject");

  Integer rtnValue = (Integer)
	       manager.callServerObjectMethod(
		  serverObjectRoute.copy(),
		  "doThis",
		  new String[] {"java.lang.Integer.class"},
		  new Object[] {new Integer(5)});

</pre>
    The difference between ServerObjects and Tasks/Sequences are that
    ServerObjects do not have the implicit progress reporting feature,
    nor are they asynchronous (unless <em>you</em> implement it within
    the ServerObject).  However, the ServerObjects are not limited to
    the API enforced by the Task/Sequence infrastructure.
    <p>
      These ideas are all used in the following example...
    <p>
    </ul>
        
<h3><a name="example">4. Step-by-Step Install Wizards Example</a></h3>
    This example builds a complete install wizard, inserting our
    <code>CustomPanel</code> into the wizard sequence just before the <a
      href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.panels.WelcomePanel.html">WelcomePanel</a>.
    The Custom Panel asks the user for a filename.  It then uses a
    <strong>ServerObject</strong> to see if that file exists, and if it
    does, runs a <strong>Sequence</strong> which contains a
    <strong>Task</strong> which does nothing (remember, this is an
    example).  While the sequence runs, the progress is reported. When the
    Sequence is done, the next panel is visited automatically.
    
    <ul>
      <li><h4><a name="customserverobject">1. Creating the custom ServerObject.</a></h4>
  You must create a custom server object.  We will call it

Its highlights are:<p>
<ul>

<li><code>SEQUENCE_NAME</code>: Another convenience declaration, much
like <code>SERVER_OBJECT__NAME</code> above.<p>

<li><code>completionTime</code>: So the Task will remember how long it
should execute for at runtime.<p>

<li><code>canceled</code>: Used to know if the task gets cancelled so
it can stop what it's doing<p> <li><code>CustomTask(int)</code>: Used
at buildtime to create a task and tell it how long it will execute at
runtime<p>

<li><code>perform()</code>: The actual guts of the task.  This method
waits for the number of seconds specified in the constructor, all the
while updating its progress (which gets sent back to the panel; see
below).<p>

<li><code>cancel()</code>: Executed when the task gets cancelled (via
the <code>cancelSequence()</code> API). Do what you must here.<p>

<li><code>addRuntimeResource()</code>: Same as above; declare any
needed classes here.<p>

<hr>
Its highlights are
<p>
<ul>

<li><code>passed</code>: Once the user gives a good filename and the
task is run, this flag tells the panel not to ask again, but to let
the user through.<p>

<li><code>file</code>: Java AWT Component to hold the user's input<p>

<li><code>label</code>: Java AWT Component to give the user messages
and to prompt him.<p>

<li><code>PROMPT</code>: Just a prompt.  No Black Magic here.<p>

<li><code>CustomPanel()</code>: Default constructor.  Good idea to
have one.<p>

<li><code>CustomPanel(WizardState, String)</code>: Buildtime
constructor that we will call in the builder.<p>

<li><code>CustomPanel(String, Route,
WizardTreeManager)</code>:<strong>Your custom panel MUST have one of
these!</strong> During Wizard initialization, all of the panels are
brought out of the archive and instantiated with this constructor.  If
your panel does not have one, a <code>NoSuchMethodException</code>
will result, and your user will be very perplexed.<p>

<li><code>createUI()</code>: Called <em>once</em> when the panel is
first shown.  You should instantate your UI here.  The custom panel
creates it's components here and adds them to the object itself.<p>

<li><code>setProgress()</code>: Called if this panel executes a
sequence.  The array passed in represents the progress if the
particular sequence it called, and any parent wizards (See the <a
href="HierarchyTutorial.html">hierarchical wizard tutorial</a> for
more information).  Basically, with a single wizard, the array has one
element, the overall progress of the currently executing sequence.  We
use this information to update the panel.<p>

<li>isDisplayComplete()</code>: This method is doing the actual
interaction with the <strong>ServerObject</strong> and
<strong>Task/Sequence</strong> Pair.  First we see if we've already
"passed".  If so, disable the GUI components and move on (by returning
<code>true</code>, indicating to the wizard it is OK to move to the
next panel).  Otherwise, contact the server object and call it's
<code>doesExist()</code> method, to see if the file actually exists.
If it does not, tell the user (via the <code>displayQuery()</code>
API), and refuse to go to the next panel (by returning
<code>false</code>).  Otherwise, the file does indeed exist, so we run
the sequence by using the <code>performSequence</code> API.<p>
<p>

<em>Why do the two calls to <code>doesExist()</code> and
<code>performSequence</code></em> look so funny?</em>.  You may notice
that the two calls in the <code>isDisplayComplete()</code> method do
not look like ordinary java method calls. There are arrays of Strings,
arrays of Objects, and Routes involved in them.  Why?  The answer lies
in the client-server separation of wizards.  Method calls from the
client to the server (like <code>performSequence</code> and
<code>doesExist</code>) might be travelling between two machines
connected by a network, instead of in the same computer.  In this
case, the call must proceed through Java's Remote Method Invocation
architecture.  we have abstracted this idea another level so that
panels have <em>no idea</em> they might not be on the same machine.
In addition, there is no dealing with any special Exceptions.

<li><code>sequenceComplete()</code>: This method is called by the
server when the sequence completes (since we declared this method to
be called at sequence completion (see the
<code>performSequence()</code> call above)).  Here, we tell the user
the sequence is done, and enable the buttons we had previously
disabled, and automatically advance to the next panel.

<li><code>addRuntimeResource()</code>: Same as above; declare any
needed classes here.

</ul>

<li><h4><a name="custombuilder">4. Creating and Compiling the Wizard Builder</a></h4>
In order to tie all of the pieces together, a builder must be written,
as must be done for any wizard.  The custom builder that we will
create doesn't have any complex files, but it demonstrates how to
generate the sequence of panels that install wizards generally have.
It also creates a simple <em>Product Tree</em> that installs sample
files located in the SDK.  The basic set of panels and tasks involved
in an install wizard can be found in the
<code>com.sun.install.panels</code> and the
<code>com.sun.install.tasks</code> packages in the SDK.
<p>
Most of the complexities of building an install wizard have been
abstracted in the <a
href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.products.InstallArchiveWriter.html">InstallArchiveWriter</a>
API.  However, in this example, we will show a basic builder that does
not use the <code> InstallArchiveWriter</code> API.  Rather, it
directly works with the <code>ArchiveWriter</code> API, just as the
<code>InstallArchiveWriter</code> class does.  In this way, you can
see what kind of code is required to create a somewhat complex wizard.
Also, this can serve as a beginning cut at creating your wizard, with
further customization to be done by the developer as needed.
<p>
<a href="../src/CustomBuilder.java">Here is the
code</a> for the sample builder that generates an install wizard that
you might get out of <code>InstallArchiveWriter</code>.  Feel free to
use this as the beginning of your customized install wizard if
desired.
<p>
The builder simply instantiates the client tree and the product tree
and saves it in the wizard, to be used later by the Panel.
<p>
To compile the wizard (assuming you are in the directory where your custom classes are):
<pre>
<strong>$ javac CustomTask.java CustomServerObject.java CustomPanel.java CustomBuilder.java</strong>
</pre>
This will result in all of the classes being built.  Then, to run create the wizard archive itself:
<pre>
<strong>$ java CustomBuilder</strong>
</pre>
<p>
This will result in a file called <code>myProduct.class</code>, which represents your wizard.
<p>
<li><h4><a name="customwizard">5. Running the wizard</a></h4>
To Run your wizard, simply execute as usual:
<pre>
<strong>$ java myProduct</strong>
</pre>
The first panel after the <a href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.install.panels.WelcomePanel.html">WelcomePanel</a> will
be our custom panel.  Enter a filename.  If the file exists, the task will run and reports its progress, and then you will
be able to advance into the actual install wizard.
</ul>
<h3><a name="conclusion">5. Conclusion</a></h3>
This tutorial covered the basic ideas behind custom install wizards,
and how to write custom panels that interact with custom <a
href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.ServerObject.html">
ServerObjects</a> and custom <a
href="../../../docs/api/com.sun.wizards.core.Task.html">Tasks</a> to
accomplish things. This idea can be extended to perform any task or
other function while interacting with the user.
