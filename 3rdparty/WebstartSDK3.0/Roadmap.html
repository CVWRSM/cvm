      <h1>WebStart SDK Roadmap</h1>
      This SDK has been used by Sun to install several products on 
      Solaris 2.7 including Solaris Easy Access Server, Netscape, and
      Answerbooks .  Additional work has been put into the SDK 
      to make it easier to develop not only install wizards, but also 
      configuration wizards.
<p>
      This roadmap reveals our progress in this endeavor as well
      as the future plans for the SDK.

      <h2>InstallShield Builder Roadmap</h2>

<p>InstallShield Software Corporation and Sun Microsystems, Inc. have
formed an alliance to simplify application deployment on the
Solaris operating environment. The joint effort will shorten
application development cycles by providing an easy, cross-platform
installation look and feel &#151; making the simplicity familiar to
current InstallShield users available on the Solaris operating
environment. </p>

<p>InstallShield Java Edition provides developers with a visual tool
designed to create a single Java installation that's consistent in
look, feel and functionality across multiple platforms. New
InstallShield Extensions for the Java platform bring the power of Java
to installation building, allowing you to plug your own Java-based
extensions into your installation. And the InstallShield Installation
Applet lets you create a seamless cross-platform launch site for your
installation.</p>

<p>Sun Microsystems InstallShield Software Corporation are
co-developers of the Solaris Web Start Wizards. This set of Java
classes will be included in the runtime version of the InstallShield
Java Edition tool and as an API in the Solaris operating
environment. Using InstallShield's tools in combination with the
Solaris Web Start Wizard technology, developers will be able to build
cross-platform installations and allow administrators to easily
install Solaris applications both locally and remotely across the
network. </p>
