      <h1>Archive Structure</h1>
      The wizard archive is the delivery mechanism for the wizard.  Because all of the supporting
      classes, images, and data are written into this one archive file, the wizard can be
      distributed as an email attachment or, on a web page, as well as the more standard media
      for  software deployment including floppy disks and cdroms.  Having a single archive file means
      that the wizard itself does not need to be installed for the wizard to run.  The
      simplicity of execution this provides makes the self-extracting wizard a good choice for
      web or email deployment.  This section discusses the wizard archive structure. 
      <p>
	The archive can be run through a Java Virtual Machine.  It  extracts
	the other classes and data.  The Java class file that facilitates this is the
	ArchiveClassLoader.  The ArchiveClassLoader class bytes comprise the beginning of the
	wizard  archive.  The remaining data (supporting classes, images, audio, initialization
	data) are written into a class attribute that is added to the ArchiveClassLoader at build
	time.  Class attributes are generally ignored by the Java Virtual Machine.  Attributes  provide the virtual machine with extra information about the class to enable debugging
	features, such as source code line numbers.  Java virtual machines are prohibited from
	throwing an exception or refusing to use a class simply because an attribute unknown to
	the virtual machine is present in the class bytes.
	<p>
	Here is a diagram that indicates the contents and order of the wizard archive:

	<p>
	The Standard Archive Resources section of the wizard archive contains all of the
	supporting class files that the wizard requires.  It also contains any images or audio
	data that the wizard uses.  All of the resources written into the
	StandardArchiveResources section of the wizard archive are in the form of files.  A
	common stream format is used to write that information into the archive:
	<pre>
	short resourceCount;    // The number of resources in this section.
	for each resource:
		UTF name;       // The classname, imagename, filename.
		int length;     // The number of bytes that comprise this resource.
                byte[] bytes;   // The actual bytes representing the resource.
        </pre>
      <p>
      Each resource in the Standard Archive Resources section has a type identifier.  This
      identifier is used at build time to group sets of resources and at runtime to find the
      resources in the archive very quickly.  The identifier is a string that indicates what
      type of resource the file represents.  The pre-defined types are:  ArchiveReader, 
      RuntimeClasses, Images, and Audio.  Most of these are self explanatory.  The 
      ArchiveReader type is used to identify the collection of classes required to
      instantiate an ArchiveReader object.
      <p>
	The Custom Archive Resources section can be used to contain any data that a particular
	wizard might require.  For example, an installation wizard might put the files to be
	installed into the Custom Archive Resources section.  The mechanism to accomplish that
	will be discussed in <a href="Section9.html">The Wizard Archive Builder</a>.
	<p>
	The WizardState Initialization Data section contains all of the information required to
	properly initialize the WizardState object at runtime.  The Java Serializable interface
	is used to accomplish most of the serialization of the server-side classes.  The
	exception to this rule is the WizardState object.  WizardState is not a
	Serializable object, to make accidental references to the WizardState object on the
	client side more obvious.  Instead, the WizardState has a method (getSerializedData)
	that returns a byte array representing the entire WizardState (along with the Sequences,
	Tasks, and all data set into the WizardState at build time).  Child wizard references
	are written into the WizardArchive as relative paths from the parent wizard archive to
	the child wizard archives.  These paths are resolved at runtime to create the WizardState
	objects representing each child.
	<p>
	The Client Tree section of the archive represents the classes, order, structure, and panel
	initialization data of the panels that define the user experience for the wizard.  The
panel serialization is accomplished through the serialize method within each panel.
	<P>The Java Serializable interface is not used for the panels for a few reasons:</P> 
<UL>
<LI>To avoid
	accidental references to the panels within the server objects, and to allow each panel
	maximum flexibility over the format of all of the data saved in the archive 
<LI>to allow
	each panel to perform extra initialization processing when the panel is deserialized. 
</UL> 

<P>The
	actual classes that comprise the client tree are written into the Standard Archive
	Resources section of the archive, and are loaded through the ArchiveClassLoader object.
	<p>
	The Offset Table section of the wizard archive stores offsets that point to the various
	parts of the archive.  This lookup table enables fast access to the data within the
	archive.
	<p>
	The Table Pointer section of the archive is a pointer to the beginning of the Offset Table
	section.  Because this pointer falls at the end of the archive file, it is quite easy to
	access the Offset Table, which is the table of contents for the wizard.  This feature
	facilitates the wizard hierarchy by making it easy for one wizard to read another wizard's
	archive file.
