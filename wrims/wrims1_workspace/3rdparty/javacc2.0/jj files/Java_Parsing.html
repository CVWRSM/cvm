<p>I've always been interested in writing compilers and interpreters. I once wrote a Basic compiler in Basic just to prove it could be done (not to mention win a bet involving  a case of a refreshing cold beverage). At the heart of each  of these language translation programs is parser code that analyzes input according to a specific set of rules, known  as a grammar.</p>

<p>Grammar-based parsers aren't limited to programming languages. In fact, some of the most sophisticated parsers ever were the ones in the old text-based adventure games popular around the time the PC made its debut. Other parsers might handle mathematical equations, natural language input, or search engine queries.</p>


<p>So why would a Web developer want to parse input? One reason might be to create offline tools to generate or maintain programs or Web pages. Or you might want to handle incoming text from a Web form (such as a natural-language query). In either situation, a good parser is invaluable.</p>





<H3><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Tools of the Trade</FONT></H3>


<p>At first glance, you might think that parsing a language is trivial: You just need to write several <code>if</code> statements that use <code>String.equals</code> to spot keywords. While you might be able to handle some simple grammars that way, however, complex ones require a lot more work. You might want to skip certain words, or deal with a word differently depending on which words follow it. Parsers can become so complex that people who write them often seem to speak their own peculiar jargon, expounding on LALR grammars, lexing, and recursive descent.</p>

<p>Luckily, tools exist that can hide most of the arcane details of parser creation from you. The most familiar tools are YACC and its open-source counterpart, Bison. These tools (which output parsers written in C) let you focus on the format of your language and on what you want to do when you find certain items in the input. Fortunately, a similar tool exists for Java. It's known as JavaCC. The only problem is finding it.</p>


<p>Sun originally developed JavaCC as part of another package, one it no longer distributes. Another company, Metameta, took over the distribution of JavaCC, but then it sold out  to WebGain. It wasn't easy to find JavaCC starting from WebGain's home page, but eventually I spotted it. The direct link in

<B>Online Resources</B> takes you to  the JavaCC main page.</p>





<H3><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Using JavaCC</FONT></H3>


<p>JavaCC is a command-line compiler that processes special source files and converts them into Java source code. By convention, these source files use the .jj extension. Once you have the Java source code, you further compile it (perhaps as part of a larger project) in the normal way.  This is usually done with the javac utility.</p>

<p>There are three major components in the .jj files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Definitions of terminal tokens (or terminals)&#151;that is, words you expect to see in the input.
<li>Rules about how tokens combine to form legal statements (called productions) in the language.
<li>Java code to tie everything together and perform actions when certain productions occur.
</ul>



<p>In parser-speak, anything you can legally say in the language you're parsing is called a token. Tokens can consist of other tokens, or they can be terminal tokens, the smallest subdivision. Consider HTML as an example language that needs to be parsed. Here's a typical hyperlink:</p>
<p>
<code>&lt;A HREF=http://www.webtechniques.com&gt;</code></p>

<p>A parser might consider this statement to contain  six tokens: &lt;, A, HREF, =, the URL, and &gt;. All of these are terminal tokens. </p>


<p>Yet taken together, this list of terminal tokens might also form a more complex token (not a terminal). I might call this a TAG token, and I could describe it to JavaCC like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;TAG&gt; := &lt;OPENBRACKET&gt;&lt;ANCHOR&gt;&lt;HREF&gt;&lt;CLOSEBRACKET&gt;</code></p>

<p>Here &lt;ANCHOR&gt; represents the terminal that is the letter A. The &lt;OPENBRACKET&gt; and &lt;CLOSEBRACKET&gt; tokens are also terminals. However, the HREF token could comprise other tokens (&lt;HREFKEYWORD&gt;, &lt;EQUALS&gt;, and &lt;URL&gt;). These subtokens might be terminals (for instance, &lt;HREFKEYWORD&gt; might map to the string "HREF").  Or, they might themselves be complex tokens. You could write &lt;URL&gt; as a sequence of other tokens, for example. </p>

<p>JavaCC lets you easily describe these relationships once you understand the format of .jj files. To get you started, there's an entire HTML grammar that you can study in the <a href="http://www.cobase.cs.ucla.edu/pub/javacc" target="new">JavaCC Grammar Repository</a>, and another is included with  the JavaCC distribution.</p>


<p>Input files may start with a section of options to configure the type of parser JavaCC will generate. For example, you might set <code>IGNORE_CASE</code> to force your parser to treat upper- and lowercase characters the same. Another important option is <code>STATIC</code>. If you  set this option to <code>true</code>, your parser will be more efficient, because it won't attempt to track multiple instances of the parser object. On the downside, that means you won't be able to instantiate multiple instances safely.</p>

<p>After the options (if you use any) comes a <code>PARSER_BEGIN</code> statement. JavaCC uses the string you pass to this statement to name your parser's class file. After the statement, you can add in any Java subroutines you choose. You should also write a <code>main</code> method that instantiates the parser, so you can test it from the command line. This section of the file terminates with a <code>PARSER_END</code> statement.</p>


<p>The last part of the file contains the token definitions and productions. You can usually start with a simple file (like the one in <b>Listing 1</b>) to get the basic format, then you can expand  it to handle your specific parser. The parser in Listing 1 reads an Input token. This token consists of one or more <code>Id</code> tokens. The <code>Id</code> tokens consist of a letter, followed by zero  or more letters, numbers, or underscores.  The parser skips blanks, tabs, carriage returns, and newlines. If you're familiar with regular expression notation, you should be able to figure out the grammar without checking  the JavaCC documentation.</p>

<p>In <b>Listing 1</b>, each production has an empty pair of braces at the beginning. This is where you can place Java code for the production (usually variable declarations). Within the production rules, you can add more braces  and insert Java code that will execute when that production matches. You'll see how this works in <b>Listing 4</b> and <b>Listing 5</b>.


<p>When you run JavaCC to compile your .jj file into a .java file, the compiler will also generate certain ancillary files (unless they already exist). These files are not dependent on your grammar&#151;they just contain helper classes that the generated parser needs to do its work. The only reason you'd ever need to generate them again would be if you changed the value of the <code>STATIC</code> option&#151;the files differ slightly when you change this value. If you're ever in doubt, simply erase these files and JavaCC will generate them when you compile your next .jj file.</p>




<H3><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">A JSP Generator</FONT></H3>


<p>Imagine you're writing a program that takes pseudocode and produces proper ISP code as output. <b>Listing 2</b> shows the JSP-like input that needs parsing. Instead of using HTML syntax, however, it uses <code>field</code> and <code>submit</code> statements to define form elements. By default, each element appears on its own line unless it's part of a group (signified by the <code>group</code>  and <code>endgroup</code> statements).</p>

<p>The form ends with a <code>Begin_java</code> statement, followed by JSP code that handles the form's processing (until the <code>//END_JAVA</code> statement). The resulting JSP appears in <b>Listing 3</b>.
</p>


<p>This language is much trickier to parse  than the simple <code>Id</code> token parser in Listing 1.  In particular, this parser requires two different states: one for the field definitions, and another for the Java code (which isn't really parsed at all). In <b>Listing 4</b>, the <code>Begin_Java</code> token accomplishes this by setting a new mode (<code>JCODE</code>). This causes the parser to use a separate set of tokens from  the normal mode, which is <code>DEFAULT</code>. When  in <code>JCODE</code> mode, the code in <b>Example 1</b> causes the parser to read all of the input up to the ending <code>//END_JAVA</code> token.</p>


<p>Notice that the end token also switches back to <code>DEFAULT</code> mode. The <code>Input</code> token, as before, defines the entire file.  <b>Example 2</b> is an excerpt from that production rule with comments following each line. For clarity, I didn't show the actions&#151;you can find the entire code for this token <b>Listing 4</b>. </p>


<p>Now consider <b>Example 3</b>, which shows the complete production for normal HTML fields. The first set of braces holds variables that will contain the component parts of the statement. The second set holds the actual production rule. In this case, the statement consists of the word <code>FIELD</code> followed by a field ID (<code>&lt;ID&gt;</code>). You can optionally include a prompt, the size of the field, and the maximum number of characters the user can enter.</p>


<p>The last part of the production writes out the correct HTML for the field. The <code>emit</code> function  is something I wrote that writes a <code>String</code> or <code>Token</code> object out to the output file. The <code>Token</code> object is part of JavaCC's suite of objects, and contains the part of the input that the parser identified as the current token. The parser makes this assignment when you write something like: </p>



<p><code>fid=&lt;ID&gt;</code> </p>



<p>Puzzling this parser out is a good exercise. It's complicated enough to be meaningful, but not as complicated as some of the example parsers included with JavaCC. Once you comprehend this one, you can tackle some  of the examples in the distribution (such as  the Java or C parsers).</p>





<H3><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Fun and Games</FONT></H3>


<p>You can also use a parser to process input from the Web by coupling a JavaCC parser with a JSP page. <b>Listing 5</b> provides a parser for a simple text-based adventure game, but the same principles would apply to a natural-language query system or some other more serious system. </p>

<p>The game is a simple dungeon-style adventure. You can enter commands like "Open the door please" (just "Open door" will do, too). The core idea behind this command structure  is that you typically have a verb and a noun&#151;for example "Get sword." No other input really matters. There are a few one-word commands such as <code>HELP</code>, <code>QUIT</code>, and <code>LOOK</code>. You can also abbreviate <code>GO</code> commands to a single letter, corresponding to a specific direction (<code>N</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>E</code>, or <code>W</code>). </p>


<p>This parser has a few interesting points. First, it doesn't really know how the game works. It delegates that responsibility to the <code>Game</code> object, which is ordinary Java code (no JavaCC involved). This object acts on the noun and verb to formulate a text reply. Most objects in the game are also Java objects derived from the abstract <code>AdventObject</code> class. You can find all of these classes in the online listings.</p>


<p>Since the <code>LOOK</code> command does double duty, this parser requires extra look-ahead (no pun intended). You can type <code>LOOK</code> to just look around, or you can look at something in  particular (<code>"LOOK BEAR"</code>). The parser can  only resolve which command you want by looking ahead one token.</p>


<p>The parser uses noise disposal to handle verbose commands. Simply put, it skips words like the, a, an, and please. In retrospect,  it would probably be nice if it ignored punctuation as well. That functionality would be simple to add.</p>


<p>When the parser encounters an error, it throws an exception. The driver code catches this exception, then calls <code>ReInit</code> to handle the next line. How you reach the next line depends on how your input arrives. The JavaCC documentation explains how to use <code>getToken</code> to scan for the next line or statement. For a JSP, however, each line is separate. For the test <code>main</code> function, I simply flush the input by reading all available input until there is no more, before restarting the parse.</p>


<p>If any part of the game generates a string that starts with <code>@ @ @</code>, the driver takes this as a signal to end the game. The driver cuts these flag characters off, displays the string, and then quits.</p>




<H3><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Java@Work Retires?</FONT></H3>


<p>When I accepted the Java column in this magazine (in July 1998) things were quite different from the way they are now. Back then, Visual J++ and Java Studio were still around, and there was probably more applet development than server-side development. Things certainly have changed.</p>

<p>As I look around, things are still changing. Very few of us have the luxury of programming in Java alone these days. Your systems may draw on Java, XML, ASP, C#, PHP, Perl, and a host of other tools and languages. To better serve your needs, this will be my last "Java@Work" column. Next month, you'll find a somewhat new column in this space. I'll still talk about Java frequently; however, I'll also show you other tools and techniques, both where they interface with Java and as stand-alone solutions. What tools do you use?
