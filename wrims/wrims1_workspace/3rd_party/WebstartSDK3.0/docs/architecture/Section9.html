      <h1>The Wizard Archive Builder</h1>
      The wizard archive discussed in <a href="Section8.html">Archive Structure</a> is created by a wizard builder.  The builder is
      a java program that initializes the WizardState, creates the wizard client tree, and then
      writes the wizard archive file.
      <p>
	A wizard builder superclass exists that contains all of the code to write the
	wizard archive.  This class is called the ArchiveWriter.  A subclass of ArchiveWriter
	must be created which overrides the createClientTree method  to build the client tree
	panel structure.  This method can also set data into the WizardState, as well as create
	Sequences.
	<p>
	The builder can create an archive with any classname that is legal with Java.  The
	classname is set by assigning the string archiveName to the desired name.  The ".class"
	extension should not be appended to the name.
	<p>
	The archive can have all of its sections compressed or not.  The default behavior is to
	not compress the sections.  Make the choice to compress the archive sections by
	setting the useCompression class variable to true.  If the useCompression flag is true,
	the ArchiveWriter uses a DeflatorOutputStream object to compress the data written into
	the archive.
	<p>
	The ArchiveWriter takes care of:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Writing the supporting class files, image files 
<LI>WizardState initialization data 
<LI>Client tree initialization data 
<LI>Keeping track of the offsets for each section 
<LI>Writing the offset table  
</UL>
<P>The ArchiveWriter
	also is responsible for creating the class attribute that stores all of this information
	within the ArchiveClassLoader class.
	<p>
	A resource collection mechanism is built into Tasks and client panels to ensure that all
	of the required supporting Java class files are written into the archive.  The mechanism
	works because each subclass of Task and each subclass of WizardComponent overrides the
	addRuntimeResources method to specify its dependencies.  This method adds each
	supporting classname to the vector that is passed in.  The ArchiveWriter collects all of
	the resources into a vector.  The vector is reduced to remove all duplicate entries.
	This vector is used to determine which class files should be added to the archive.
	<p>
	It is important to cooperate with the resource collection mechanism when writing
	Task subclasses and panels.  If a supporting class is not added to the wizard archive,
	the result will be a wizard that throws a ClassNotFound exception.
	<p>
	Data can be put into the Custom Archive Resources section of the wizard archive by
	writing an object of interface ResourceWriter.  ResourceWriter has only one method that
	is used to put data into the archive.  That method is called writeResource.  Each
	ResourceWriter object should be set into the builder through a call to the addResource
	method, which accepts a type and the ResourceWriter object.
	<p>
	After creating the wizard client tree and initializing the WizardState with data and
	Sequences, the archive is written through a call to writeArchive.
