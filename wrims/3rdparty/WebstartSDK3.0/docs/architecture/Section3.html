      <h1>The Server</h1>
     <P> The wizard architecture discussed in <a href="Section2.html">Wizard Architecture</a> is separated between
      a server and a client.  The server has the responsibility of actually
      carrying out the purpose of the wizard.  The responsibilities of the
      server include: 

<UL>
<LI>Data storage required to enable the wizard to perform
      its function 
<LI>Data retrieval from the wizard archive
<LI>Class resolution from the wizard archive 
<LI>Data retrieval facilitation from the
<LI>Client side of the wizard
<LI>Task execution  
</UL>
<P>This section
      discusses each of these responsibilities in some detail.
      <p>
	Data storage and retrieval are accomplished by the WizardState.  The
	WizardState stores data in the form of objects in a hash table.  This
	allows the storage of any number of objects.  The objects that are
	stored must be serializable.  The WizardState has two methods for data storage
	and retrieval:  setData() and getData().  These methods can be
	called either from the server or from the client.  When the WizardState
	is instantiated from the wizard archive, it reads its initial data from
	the archive.  The archive builder is responsible for writing the initial
	WizardState data into the archive.  This will be discussed in detail in
	<a href="NativeSupport.html">Native Support for Wizards</a>.
	<p>
	The responsibility of retrieving data from the wizard archive is shared
	between the WizardState and the ArchiveReader.  The ArchiveReader
	actually opens the wizard archive file and reads the data as either an
	input stream or a byte array.  The WizardState is used by objects both
	within the server and within the client to request the services of the
	ArchiveReader.  The WizardState implements the Mediator design pattern,
	which avoids proliferation of object references and interconnections
	throughout the system.  This avoidance of object interconnections is an
	important aspect of the design that enables wizards to operate with a
	network connection between the server process and the client process.
	<p>
	Resolution of classes from the wizard archive is achieved by the
	ArchiveClassLoader in conjunction with the ArchiveReader.  All of the
	resources neccessary to execute a wizard are contained within the
	wizard archive file.  These resources include all of the class files
	the wizard will instantiate, except for those classes found in the
	core Java package.
	<p>
	When the ArchiveClassLoader is instantiated, it instantiates an
	ArchiveReader.  The ArchiveReader finds the section within the wizard
	archive that contains the class bytes and submits them to the
	ArchiveClassLoader.  
	<p>
	Before each class is submitted to the class loader, the
	ArchiveClassLoader determines if the class has already
	been submitted.  Each class is accepted by the
	ArchiveClassLoader only once.  
	<p>
	In a wizard hierarchy, there is more than one wizard archive, and
	an ArchiveReader for each wizard archive, but only one ArchiveClassLoader.
	The separation of responsibilities between these two classes makes the
	wizard hierarchy possible.
	<p>
	The execution of tasks is done through the use of the Sequence class and
	subclasses of Task.  A Sequence is a container for one or more Task
	objects.  The Task object is the mechanism through which the wizard can
	manipulate the system on which the wizard server is executing.  The
	Sequence object is given a set of Task objects through calls to the
	addTask method.  The Sequence object maintains the order in which the
	Tasks were added.
	<p>
	The Sequence is executed through a call to the WizardState.  A Sequence
	can be performed or reversed.  The Sequence.perform method performs each
	Task within the Sequence in order.  The Sequenc.reverse method reverses
	each Task in the Sequence in reverse order.  This allows the wizard to do
	a specific action, and then undo that action at a later time.  If the
	Sequence is canceled (through a call to the Sequence.cancel method) during
	the perform method or the reverse method, the Sequence sends a cancel
	message to the Task that is currently executing.
	<p>
	The Sequence is able to send progress messages to the client through the
	WizardState.  In this way, a Sequence requiring lengthy execution can keep
	the user informed that progress is being made.  The Sequence always
	reports a progress between 0 and 100.
	<p>
	When the Sequence has finished its execution, the WizardState can invoke a
	callback method that is passed as an argument to either the performSequence
	method or the reverseSequence method.  The callback is useful, because it
	indicates when the Sequence has completed, and allows the object that
	initiated the Sequence to perform checks to determine the outcome.  For
	example, if one of the Tasks in the Sequence failed, it might put a flag
	into the WizardState through a call to the setData method to indicate what
	type of failure occurred.  The callback method can be used to get this
	information and display a warning to the user.
	<p>
	Each Task in the Sequence can set its progress into the Sequence object.
	The Sequence object calculates the overall progress for the entire sequence
	each time its setProgress method is called from a task.  The Sequence
	calculates the overall progress based on the estimated time each task in
	the Sequence will take.  Each Task subclass should override the
	estimatedCompletionTime method to indicate the approximate completion time
	of the Task, measured in milliseconds.
	<p>
	If the progress is going to be displayed with a progress bar on a client
	panel, make the progress bar move as smoothly as possible.
	For example, if a Task that takes a long time to perform only sets the progress at the
	beginning and end of the task execution, the progress bar movement will be
	erratic.
	<p>
	The wizard archive contains all of the information required to instantiate
	the wizard.  The WizardState facilitates the creation of the wizard archive
	by writing the information required to instantiate the server classes to an
	output stream.  This mechanism can be broken by setting non-serializable
	objects into the WizardState.  It is important that all of the objects
	set into the WizardState through calls to setData implement the Serializable
	interface.  Task subclasses must also implement the Serializable interface.  
	<p>
	Any reference to the WizardState object within a Task should use the "transient"
	modifier so the WizardState is not serialized with the object.  The WizardState
	object does not implement the Serializable interface to make it obvious if such
	a mistake is made.  This sort of mistake would be caught by running the archive
	builder, which would exit with an exception.
	<p>
	The initialization of the wizard is important to understand.  When the wizard
	archive is executed, the ArchiveClassLoader is the first object to be
	instantiated.  An instance of ArchiveReader is created, which initializes by
	reading the class bytes section of the archive.  The ArchiveReader sends the
	classname of each class found in the archive to the ArchiveClassLoader to
	determine if the class bytes for that class should be submitted.  If the class
	is not already known to the ArchiveClassLoader, it will accept the class bytes.
	<p>
	The ArchiveReader then instantiates a WizardState object.  During initialization
	of the WizardState object, all of the data objects that were set into the
	WizardState at buildtime are read from the archive.  After the data is recreated,
	the Sequences and their Tasks are read from the wizard archive.
	<p>
	If the WizardState has children, an ArchiveReader is created for each child.
	Each ArchiveReader object then tries to submit its archive classes to the
	ArchiveClassLoader.  The ArchiveReader creates a WizardState object for each child.  This creation and initialization of the WizardState and its
	children continues recursively until there are no more WizardState children.
	There is no theoretical limit to the number of child WizardState objects that
	can be created.  The practical limit is dependent on the amount of memory in the
	system using the wizard hierarchy.
	<p>
	When all of the child WizardState objects have been created, the root
	WizardState object performs the initialization sequence.  The wizard archive
	builder can put tasks into the initialization sequence that should be performed
	when the wizard archive is launched.
