      <h1>Remote Wizards</h1>
      Remote wizard operation enables a user to execute and
      configure a wizard from a different machine than the one being affected by
      the wizard.  This is accomplished primarily through the use of the
      client-server programming model.
      <p>
	In the wizard API, the client is the user interface.  The user interface
	includes the panels that manipulate the configuration of the wizard, as well
	as the structure that supports those panels.  The WizardConsole,
	WizardTreeManager, IteratorLayout, navigation panel, and the image panel are
	all pieces of the wizard client. These objects must not directly perform any
	action that would not be permitted within a Java-enabled web browser.  For
	example, these objects cannot create an instance of a File object that will
	be used to read a file, create a file, check the length of a file, or check
	the existence of a file.  This would result in a security exception if the
	wizard were to be operated remotely.
	<p>
	The server in the wizard API is everything but the user interface.  This
	includes the WizardState, all Sequence objects and the Task objects they
	contain, and all data that is written into the WizardState either at build
	time or at run time.  The server has permission to do anything the operating
	system will allow.  This includes creating and deleting files, assuming
	the server is running with proper permissions.
	<p>
	The client and server communicate between the WizardTreeManager object on the
	client side and the root WizardState object on the server side.  The
	WizardTreeManager maintains a reference to the WizardState object. Through
	that reference it can call WizardState methods.  Likewise, the root WizardState
	object maintains a reference to the WizardTreeManager object so it can call
	client object methods.

	<p>
	When working remotely, one other object is used to facilitate this communication.
	This object, RemoteWizardConsoleState, is used to communicate with the WizardState
	object through Remote Method Invocation (RMI).  The RemoteWizardConsoleState
	follows the Proxy design pattern, which converts direct WizardState messages from
	the WizardTreeManager object into RMI calls.  The RemoteWizardConsoleState also
	accepts messages from the WizardState object, whose target is the WizardTreeManager.
	The RemoteWizardConsoleState implements the WizardState interface, to complete
	messages from the client to the server, and forwards messages being sent from the
	server to the client.
	<p>

	<p>
	The RMI scheme requires at least one server object to register itself with an RMI
	object registry.  This is the lookup mechanism that enables an object to obtain a
	reference to a remote object.  The GenericRemoteWizardState object registers itself.
	This object implements the WizardState interface and is actually subclassed from
	GenericWizardState, which defines the behavior of the WizardState interface for
	local use.  The subclass registers itself on the RMI registry and catches
	the RemoteException for methods that communicate between the server and the client.
	<p>
	A single point of contact between the server and the client provides
	an easy way to achive remote operation without tying the entire design to RMI.  This
	Remote operation of wizards was a chief goal in the design of the wizard
      application framework.  This contributes to the platform independence of
	wizards.  RMI requires TCP/IP to be installed and working.  Some operating systems
	do not install TCP/IP unless a network card is installed.  If RMI were required for
	all wizards to operate, wizards could never be platform independent.  This would
	severely limit the audience for any particular wizard.
