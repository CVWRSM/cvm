      <h1>Wizard Architecture</h1>

      The wizard architecture is divided between the server and the client.
      Any confusion about which classes are executed
      in the server and which classes are executed in the client could lead
      to creating a wizard that does not work remotely. This section discusses the wizard architecture to prevent such confusion.
      <p>
	The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the wizard
	runtime classes.  The classes on the left are classes that are
	executed only on the server.  The classes on the right are executed
	only on the client.

	<h4><a name="Server classes">Server Classes:</h4>
	The server classes include the WizardState, the Sequence, the Task,
	the ArchiveReader, and the ArchiveClassLoader.
	<p>
	The WizardState is the main object defining the server.  The WizardState
	holds the data required to perform the action (which is the purpose of
	the wizard).  WizardState is also the object responsible for managing
	Sequences of Tasks.  This management includes storage, serialization,
	deserialization, and execution of the Sequences.  A WizardState object
	can have child WizardState objects.  This will be discussed in detail in
	the Wizard Hierarchy section.
	<p>
	The Sequence is a container object for tasks.  Tasks within the Sequence
	can be performed when the Sequence is performed.  The Sequence is stored
	in theWizardState.
	<p>
	The Task is an object that actually performs an action.  This is the
	mechanism through which a wizard fulfills it purpose.  A task is
	performed within the server, and has permission to create, modify, and remove
	files; execute processes, use the network, connect to already running
	processes, and so on.  The Task object can be written for a specific operating
	system or can be platform independent, depending on the requirements of
	the Task.  Each Task to be performed during execution of the wizard is
	placed into a Sequence.  When the Sequence is performed (a responsibility
	of the WizardState), each task is given the opportunity to perform its
	action.
	<p>
	The ArchiveReader is responsible for reading the resources out of the
	wizard archive.  These resources can be read as an input stream or as
	a byte array.  For some resources (for example, images), an element within the
	resource section can be read rather than reading the entire resource section.
	This enables the client to request a single image rather than being
	required to cache all of the images found within the image resource
	section in the archive.  The client can have access to the ArchiveReader
	through the WizardState object.
	<p>
	The ArchiveClassLoader is responsible for resolving class files from
	within the wizard archive.  This object has a limited ability to read
	the wizard archive file.  The complete responsibility for reading the
	archive lies with the ArchiveReader.  
	<p>
	The ArchiveReader and the ArchiveClassLoader coordinate their
	responsibilities.  The ArchiveClassLoader instantiates the ArchiveReader.
	The ArchiveReader submits classes from within the archive (in bytecode
	form) to the ArchiveClassLoader.  The ArchiveClassLoader is then able to
	resolve classes that originated in the wizard archive for the Java Virtual
	Machine.  The ArchiveReader is responsible for
	reading the class bytes from the wizard archive in order to facilitate a
	wizard hierarchy.
	<p>
	<h4><a name="Client classes">Client Classes:</h4>
	The client classes include the wizard panels that are subclassed from
	WizardComponent, the WizardTreeManager, and the WizardConsole.

	The wizard panels are the objects that provide the user experience of
	the wizard.  These panels may include information the user should know and
	default settings that the user can change, and provide the order in which
	information should be entered.  The panels guide the execution of the wizard.
	<p>
	The WizardTreeManager provides a container in which the wizard panels can
	operate.  It is the main object on the client side of the wizard
	architecture.  The WizardTreeManager manages the wizard panels, creates
	the navigation buttons, and provides the image panel that is displayed
	within the wizard.
	<p>
	The WizardConsole is the interface into the system environment.  The
	WizardConsole has code that can exit the application, disconnect from the
	server (if running remotely), and catch top level window events.
