Install instructions:
When you download the JavaCC software, you get a single file called JavaCC2_1.class. This is a Java program that installs JavaCC onto your machine. You can also download a ZIP file that contains JavaCC2_1.class. We offer the ZIP option because some browsers do not work well when downloading Java class files.

Once you have JavaCC2_1.class, you simply run it as you would any other Java program.

Type: java JavaCC2_1

Note: You should not type the .class at the end! Also make sure your CLASSPATH is set correctly. This will lead you through a sequence of screens which results in the installation of JavaCC on your machine.

To get started, take a look at the examples directory under the installation directory. Look at the README files present here for detailed information on how to get started with the examples.

The vast majority of our users are able to get productive with JavaCC after going through these examples. The remainder get productive after a couple of visits to the mailing list.
